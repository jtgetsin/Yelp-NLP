Xtreme Bean Coffee Company,"If you're looking for a great local coffee spot with plenty of tables, free wifi and local flare, then Xtreme Bean is your spot. They have a wide array of drinks and they're open later than most Phoenix area coffee shops. The place is cool especially since it's a retrofit from a bank. Great spot for creatives.,This place has the greatest hours! The people are nice and helpful with recommending different coffees based on your taste preferences. I found this place when I was still a student at ASU and it was a great go-to spot if you want to hang out/study with some friends later in the night. I've met people up here and I got to do exactly what I wanted to do: drink coffee and catch up with friends until the wee hours (conversations can run long-especially whne girls get to talking).,Love this place! Love that there is a drive-thru, and they are super speedy and friendly. They also have several sugar-free options, which is awesome. I'll be visiting this place frequently.,I've had some great coffee in my time and this place kind of swings and misses.  That being said, apparently they sell a butt ton of blended drinks so perhaps that is a big draw.
I mostly go for the fantastic night barristas, the large patio area and the folks that hang out there in this post Jamaican Blue era. 
I strongly suggest this place to a) support local endeavors, b) hang out with friends, or c) do some homework.  Don't come just for the coffee.,A good selection of coffee and tea, as well as fresh pastries and generally an assortment of sandwiches and wraps (although quantity may vary by time of day). This place is definitely packed with local students, some getting there as soon as it opens to get one of the coveted 4-seater tables with outlets. There's still room in ""The Vault"" though if all of the main tables are taken. 

The staff is pretty friendly once you get to know them, there tends to be live music from time to time (usually have a schedule up on the main counter) and the music piped in over the PA system can range from classic rock, to reggae, to psy trance, to Japanese ""J-Rock"". 

Plenty of seating for smokers in a sheltered outside area. Bathrooms are separate from the main area, across the smoker's ""hallway"" and are usually pretty clean, which is nice. Some wear is evident in the place. Some of the carpet is lose and can be a tripping hazard if they don't have it taped down, some of the chairs and tables in the smoking area are starting to break down a bit, but all in all I like it here and I keep coming back.,Alrighty, if you've been down to ""The Bean"" anytime in the last year, you've more than likely seen my mug around there. It has slowly become my home away from home, so I feel fairly competent in giving a well rounded opinion. 

First off, as has been said by others, one of The Bean's best qualities is the fact that it is open 24 hours on the weekends (Friday 5 am - Sunday 11 pm). This works out wonderfully for us 21+ who don't want the night to end after the bar's throw us out to the streets. Basically, its a ""you can't stay here, but you can go to The Bean"" kind of situation. For the rest of the week, it is open from 5 am till 11 pm, giving us night owls a place to hang around. 

Now I can get a bit into the drink and food. If you're coming to The Bean, you know the coffee is alright. It's certainly not the best cup you will get in AZ, but they do roast their own beans on premises a few times a week (ensuring a pretty fresh cup of joe). You can tell the roasting days by the smoke coming off the chimney, and the acrid, dizzying, and often intoxicating scent, suffocating the area. If the coffee is to your liking, you can purchase it to bring home, whole or pre-ground. Offering your standard array of drip, french press, espresso, latte's, cappuccinos, etc..., all available served hot or cold,  Xtreme Bean has your coffee fix, well, fixed.

For those of you not coffee inclined, the Bean offer's a large array of loose leaf teas, which you can mix and match to make your own creation (May I be allowed to recommend a Black Currant/Moroccan Mint blend, on ice?). Green teas, decaf, black, the have it all. Also offered: creme blended drinks, italian sodas in a plethora of flavors, Naked Juice.

Food wise, they keep it pretty simple at the The Bean. Made fresh every 2 days, they have salads, sandwich's, and pita wraps, as well as a grand assortment of pastries (if you get there before noon, after which the pastries are usually gone) The wraps are alright, sandwich's are ok. It's all edible, and priced a bit higher then what its worth. Bagels, muffins, doughnuts, cookies, slices of cake, and usually some sort of banana bread all grace the food cooler. 

Moving on to seating, its pretty sacred reality if you get there during peak hours. With plenty of electrical sockets inside, in the floors and in the walls, The Bean is highly lap top friendly. The Internet connection is free, but it can border on agonizingly slow when there are numerous people using it. The aptly named Vault (The Bean IS located in what at one point was a bank) is generally known to be the quiet study section. Outside, there are your standard tables and chairs, most of which are falling apart, or wobbly, or bent. During the nights it can be difficult to impossible to find a spot, especially once it gets nice out. If you aren't a fan of smokers, then you may want to sit inside as nearly the entire patio is smoker friendly (even if the ashtrays mysteriously disappear every few months). 

Every few nights, they have some sort of live music being played. Monday nights is given over to the piano and classic show tunes crowd, who, as you guessed, sing show tunes and take turns playing the piano. Loudly, might I add. Loudly, and incessantly, and they take over the majority of the seats inside. If you need to get work done on a Monday, move into the Vault (where its kind of quieter) or go outside. Friday nights are a rotation of performers, usually a single guitarist with an amp. These performers usually add more ambiance than annoyance to the atmosphere, so even if you are going to the shop to sit and talk with people, you can do just that without getting drowned out by the musicians. Be sure to request Freebird, one day someone will actually play it. 

I'm beginning to think I've rambled enough for now, but I'm fairly certain you've gotten a decent picture. Good for the people, the socialization, the place to go on weekends after, literally, everything else in Tempe has closed. If you're ever down to The Bean, feel free to say hello if you see me on the patio!,Decent coffee, good prices. They could have more vegetarian options as far as sandwiches or food are concerned.

Study area is awesome, plenty of outlets with free wi-fi to study. Though, I'm not sure I visited during peak hours and I can imagine it getting busy.

My favorite thing is that they have a drive-through. In Tempe that's a huge plus for students on the go.

I love to go here when I have a couple hours to kill and I don't feel like sifting through the crowds of students on the ASU campus or at Hayden library. But for someone who doesn't have a car, getting here could be pretty problematic.,I love this place because it has strong iced coffee, they call it ""toddy"". Man this stuff is better then all the energy drinks. They also have FREE HIGH SPEED WIRELESS!!! No kidding, unlike that other place, no sign-ups, nothing, just go and and open and go. The berista's are good, and the drinks are real good. Great looking college women all day long. The drive through is great and 24 hours on the weekends. 
This is a great independent coffee shop. 
I also have held a few business meeting in there, no problem, no one messes with ya, no one clamoring you to buy drinks. 
I recommend this place to all my friends.,they are open late and that's the one thing that sets them apart from any of the other coffee places i go to. i'll stick with gold bar or even coffee rush if it's during normal hours, tho..,I've been to the Xtreme Bean twice now and have enjoyed it both times.  Instead of going for a chill quite atmosphere, the Bean goes for a more hip & upbeat feel -- and does a good job of it.

Every time I have come there are a lot of college students studying, groups meeting for whatever reason, and other people just there to hang out.  The busy atmosphere goes really well with the feel of the place - it might be strange to be here when it was quiet or empty!

The barista's pull good shots and the pastries are good, but I was pretty disappointed when they told me no, we don't have any vegetarian sandwiches because (basically) it's not cost effective.,I like how large this place is and the different seating options to suit your needs.  This is a great place to meet up with people, close to the freeway- I see business men meeting up here, I've had study groups here and I meet with my tutor here.  Coffee and tea is consistently good.  Free wi-fi - make sure you ask for the password when you grab your drink.

They lost a star because it's kinda dirty in there - messy tables and trash on the ground.,I have been coming to xtreme bean for several years and it is still a generally good place.  the coffee is average or below, the tea selection is good, the atmosphere is ok but same old. The current staff is incredibly immature and act like children yelling, and even barking, at high decibels.  I've never seen anything like  it anywhere.  I'll have to think twice about coming back if this continues.,My friend Brad is always talking about this place.......so that says someting, either Brad needs psychological help or this place is really cool. 
Bean is great for the coffee, atmosphere and the high speed internet kicks into gear. 
Check this place out for all the greats and glorys..
Also Friday nites are open mikes with impromptu players.  

I just wanted to add a couple hints about the Bean for the new xtreme beaner.... 
*** Get their early, the internet access is free and its kicking like chuck norris. Your chances of getting a place indoors is pretty limited, so like i said get their early. In the day time, before 6. The place, power outlets and people fill up around 615. The outer patio area is still nice as well, you can find a nice spot to cozy up with a book.,In a previous life, Xtreme Bean was Gold Bar and the ""vault"" at the Gold Bar was more of a chill area with board games where people could play or chat.  Over the years, Xtreme Bean took over the building and Gold Bar moved into the Ross/Subway plaza.  The atmosphere then evolved into a haven for those that are glued to their laptops and/or those that need to intensely study.  While I do reminisce about the old days of yore, Xtreme bean does serve up very good coffee drinks that are smooth yet strong.  I've had their frappes and they have been rich, full of flavor, and not overly sweet.  They have a very wide selection of sugar free syrups too if you are wanting something less calorie intensive.,I used to frequent this location when it was Gold Bar.
I literally lived right behind the Gold Bar for a few years (and the old location of the lucky dragon :'( but that is another story.). I used to hang out there all times of day.

It seemed more ""authentic"" back then, (or maybe I am getting old and reminiscing too much.) It is not bad now, but it doesn't feel great either.

Edit: I have been using the drive thru more often now and DAMN they have good coffee!!,I go to coffee shops primarily to work and Xtreme bean is number 1 in my rotation.  The service is great and the drinks superb.  They have a free internet and the widest selection of seats to meet any need (inside and out).  

They have a piano and always seem to have some sort of live music which is always low key and never interferes with trying to work.  Also has a cool crowd.,(2 1/2 stars).

Don't get me wrong, I love hanging out here and have been doing so for a while. It's a unique spot and has a kind of awkward-but-homey feel, like it's housed in a building it's not really supposed to be in. The vibe is upbeat and friendly for the most part and it's kind of cool to hang out in a VAULT. But the two-star rating comes from the most important reason why I'm here, yo: the coffee.

I have never once had HOT coffee here. I like my coffee searing hot. Like lava. But I always get flaccid, limp, lukewarm beverages here. I even specified ""extra hot"" once and it still wasn't up to temp.

But the tea selection is really good. I like how the loose leaf is presented in a way that you can see the contents of what's in the tea blends. And the pastries always look very tempting. There's a lot of fun, zany stuff on the menu, but I have the coffee tastes of an old man. I want it plain, strong, and hot. XB seems like it may be more geared toward providing caffeine bombs pumped with sweet stuff for students pulling all-nighters.,Great place to be when I can't sleep and the sun's coming up! Showing up at 5am and snagging one of those hot, straight-from-the-ovenpumpkin muffins and a latte, watching the world light up as the sun rises... What a divine (and delicious) way to start any day!,You can't go wrong with the iced toddy! I love iced coffee, and the strength of the toddy is great, especially on a rough morning. If you love iced coffee beverages, get this rather than the lattes.,The coffee is great.  Roasted right there.  D-LISH!  However, WTF they put about 10lbs of cream cheese on every bagel...even when ""easy on the cream cheese"" is requested.  I am not sure what is going on there.  The vibe is conducive to getting work done, wi-fi and all that.  The tea selection is also great.  It has the same brand and selection as one of my favorite places in the world: Naked Coffee in Sacramento, CA.  The staff is older, nice because when it comes to coffee they are serious and know what is going on.  I really like the Mexicana.  Try it.  YUM.  I would like more food offered, or maybe just a different selection.  I have only been there in the mornings, so maybe it is different later in the day.  The rundown:

Food:  fair
Coffee: awesome
Service:  good, save the cream cheese thing (see above)
will i go back:  yes, yes
should you go:  yes, check it out at other times to and let me know how it is in the evening/mid-day.
Price:  fine.  same and most other non-starbuckian places,For some reason, I thought 1AM on a Saturday was a good time to launch a website.  Since my options for late night legal liquid crack are limited, Xtreme Bean seemed like a logical option.

I was amazed there were as many people there as there was, and was even greeted by a table of beatniks as I entered.  It took awhile to get the coffee, but it was 1AM so I gave them the benefit.  

The coffee was decent, but would have been better had it at least been luke warm.  Nevertheless, the purpose was served and the espresso is working perfectly!  I will likely be back unless they open a 24 hours coffee shop in Chandler soon.,Good place, coffee is quite good and seating is comfortable.,The hours are great but the coffee sucks. Sorry. It's just not that good. The teas are pretty good and its a good place to chill. Just stay away from the iced coffee.,I used to be a student and this place was awesome for studying and keeping caffeinated.  Now though, when I go there to relax, I feel like I'm sitting in a study hall with a coffee bar in it.  More power to them for catering to students, we all know these places are hard to find.  But, if you're a few years graduated, you may want to try somewhere else...or just get their coffee to go (it's very tasty).,I liked the feel of the place. The menu was well organized and so was the dessert counter. I ordered a Toffee Coffee Frapp and it was delicious! It had small pieces of actual toffee bar in it, which was a nice treat. The drink was blended together smoothly and it was decadently creamy. Mmmmm. A+!!! There is a lot of indoor seating as well as outdoor seating. My friends and I sat outside because it was lovely weather today around noon. I can see myself returning in the future to have another one of those toffee frapps, or I may just have to be adventurous and try one of their other unique flavors, like cookies and cream! :),Oh Xtreme Bean, our time is coming to an end.  We have spent many hours together fretting over exams and the basic science boards.  And, I just want to take this moment to let you know how much I appreciate you.

I love your employees.  Consistently nice, sometimes funny, and always quick to fulfill my order.  Their music selection is pretty awesome too.  Sometimes classic rock, sometimes a blend of old and new indie, but always good enough that I rarely put on headphones unless it's to cover up people talking.

I love your coffee, your ginormous selection of herbal teas, your jalapeno-cheddar cream cheese on a bagel, and so much more that I've tried.  I love the smell of beans roasting in the corner.

I love the comfy desk chair that my heiny is planted in at this very moment.  I love the study cubicles in the vault.  I love the ability to sit here for hours when I have to and not feel as if I'm a hinderance to your business. You are a student's dream.  And your drive-thru window is fabulous.

Except... ugh, I hesitate to even bring it up.  It's not you, it's me.  Sometimes it's so busy I can't get a seat.  And, sometimes your wifi doesn't have enough oomph to satisfy.

But your goods far outweigh your bads and I'm sure that you will make other students very happy in the future.  I will always treasure the time we have already shared and looked forward to these last few months that we have in our future.

Love Always,
Jen,Open 24 hours on week-ends, ample seating area (good for studying or hanging out and chatting), very welcoming clientele, and broad selection of coffee drinks, non-coffee drinks, and desserts, fruits, and random snacks.

The coffee isn't great but not terrible either. The Wi-Fi, while free, is fickle. 

One of my two favourite coffee places in Tempe (other is Cartel off University & Ash).,Love that Xtreme Bean has such a great drive-thru.  The coffee is good and the staff is very friendly.

I like supporting them because they aren't a big chain.  It's a blessings to see an independent doing so well when there is a Starbucks just up the street.

Blessings to them as they strive in this market.  : )KC,A-OK is exactly how I feel about Xtreme Bean. This place is often too loud for me, I tend to use coffee shops as meeting places more than study places, so loud staff and loud patrons just won't cut it. On the plus side they have tons of plug in spots, and hunkering down with headphones to do work is typically pretty easy. The coffee is also hit or miss for me, just right one day and burnt tasting the next. I'll still come here, and I encourage others to as well, just know this isn't the place for quiet ambiance.,I came here with my team of staff for a staff meeting because we prefer going and supporting local business than chains like Starbucks. And if we are meeting, why not take the opportunity to treat our staff at good quality local coffee shop too, just makes perfect sense to us.

When the 4 of us arrived, the general indoor seating area had a few large tables (large enough for 4 people) that were taken by single persons. So we resorted to having our meeting in the ""vault"" which has an open table large enough for us. This was our first time here and did not know whether the ""vault"" area was a quiet area or not, but we tried to discuss work without being overly loud. An hour later, a fellow patron leaving the room told us that it was the ""quiet room"" and that we should not be in there. 

Not seeing a single ""quiet"" sign around, I decided to confirm with Xtreme Bean staff and their response was that they don't know why people have the impression that it is a quiet room. It is just another room, nothing special about it.

So I want to make sure my fellow patron knows, if you want to have a super quiet space to work at, maybe staying at home is a better option, or go to the library. Please don't tell fellow customers to leave, especially those who could not gain access to the large tables, because those were taken by other solo customers who love to spread out their belongings on a table large enough for a group of four.

We all love to support local businesses, so please make sure you know what the ""rules"" actually are before confronting other customers about your need for ""quietness."" If that is so important to you, please stay home.

Sorry if this sounds more like a rant than a review. But I just want other customers to know about my overall experience here was a good one. 

The staff was helpful and the drinks were decent, but us customers could do better to help support the business by being a little more considerate and not take up more space than we need to. 

If you take up a table large enough for four and others had no choice but leave because of that, you are indirectly taking the business away from the coffee shop. With more people there, they will sell more drinks and food. Of course, unless you plan to purchase enough food and drinks to cover the difference between one customer and four customers. I am just talking from a business owner's point of view, since I run a small business too.

Note to staff of Xtreme Beans, please let me know if I am wrong about the ""quiet room"" since I last talked with you. I will be happy to take my staff somewhere else if the large tables were taken by single users and we could not use the customer designated ""quiet room."" 

We are definitely going to give Xtreme Bean Coffee another try though.,24 hours on weekends! cheap! some of the smokey regulars out front are a little too gandolf (the grey NOT white) and Monty Python for me. Same crowd I see at bookmans in mesa. They are all at least level 9 mages...which is nothing yelpzilla can't destroy. The hardest part of this place for em is the Japanese conversation club that meets here on Fridays. Hearing my mother tongue makes me want to crush the city. So please think about the children and find another place to meet. and Also, a note to the staff, stop playing Pinkerton era Weezer. It has the same effect. I do love me the staff. If I were to destroy Tempe i would let them all ride on my back! we would destroy the city as a team! I would stomp and breathe fire and they would keep me going with shots and lattes.

Lastly, What s with all the skinny chicks with silly names giving this place one star?,Oh man.  I love this place.  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)

+ Open 24 hours on the weekends.  'Nough said.

+ Cheap, but flavorful, drinks.  I always like what I get here.  There is one guy who makes a mean vanilla latte, I have yet to get his name.

+ Food.  Good cakes and cookies.

-/+ I've found that a lot of high school kids like to loiter here (and they're loud).  But, hey, it's not XB's fault.

+ The people who work here know what they're doing.  They make sure to get your order right.  And they're always friendly.

+ They have musical guests every now and then... and it's usually good stuff.,the espresso is smooth and delightful.  they have huge cups for their ice drinks.  i got 3 shots over ice for about $2.50.  fair deal.  
i got a toffee coffee blended drink, i like the bits on top, but the drink itself was kind of lacking.  it wasn't bad, just wasn't great.
i would hang out here if i lived in the area, there is outdoor and indoor seating.  they have people play music from time to time as the fliers suggested.  there was a good crowd at both times when we went, first in the evening, then mid morning.,Great coffee and cute staff. What else do you need.,Very cool, great music. Study room but beware of the smoke cloud surrounding the outside. Can't sit outside unless you want to leave smelling like smoke.,The place is really great for late study because they open 24 hours on friday and saturday, and until 11 pm on sunday. The solo singer that played on friday night was very distracted for me. I didn't felt his music that can bring studying mood brighter, I mean I felt bored with the songs and the rhythm of the music. Please change the singer. The reggae songs from the radio that this shop playing when he was in time break was more entertaining for me. The tea and the coffee is very fresh and many types of them that you can try!,So Indie its going to make me drive to Tempe lol Love the vibe here. Reminds me of The Jamaican Blue that use to be in Scottsdale. Good mix of a crowd, indie, punk, 70s sounds. Its great,I have coffee here a couple of times a week, primarily because the self-appointed coffee dude at work makes undrinkable sludge, and because they are 2 blocks from work and have a drive-thru.  

Why only 3 stars? Inconsistency. My latte ranges from piping hot to lukewarm, from delicious to drinkable, from hella-sweet to kind of bitter. It all depends on who makes it. My favorite barista is the slender, friendly, pierced young woman, who always makes the perfect cup. I also used to like their croissants, and keep hoping that they will go back to baking them more thoroughly. Right now, they are cold and doughy, and pale as a Swede in winter. Sometimes they have also tasted day-old. 

At least the Bean is not Starschmucks...,Xtreme Bean Rules. Any bank-become-coffee-shop is a place for me.. 

We started hitting up XB back in '03 because it is open 24 hours on the weekend ... not to mention they give you double the size that you would get at Starbucks for less. Also like the idea that it is not a giant chain coffee shop. 

Great selections of coffees, teas (loose leaf), bakery items, frozen/blended drinks and Italian soda's. We LOVE the Carmel Royales.

They have tons of space to play games, and they even have some games and books in one of the back rooms. They also frequently have live bands or musicians performing and FREE WI-FI that works really well. 

XB rules.,bank building turn to a coffee beanery is way cool. 

plenty of seats to settle yourself in and crack open your books and do your homework. the free wi-fi is helpful too, but the connection lags sometimes when their a bunch of people hopping online to check their myspace.

it gets chilly at time, i suggest bring a sweater if you're the unlucky one seated underneath the A/C vent. 

the vault room is great when trying to escape the loud chatter in the main room, just don't forget to turn off your cell phone when you're in there, it's kind of rude...

if you wanna be shaking out of your pants, i suggest the Iced Toddy. it's strong and it should keep you up all night if you have a big project the following day.

customer service is very nice and helpful.,My favorite place to study in Tempe!  This funky little cafe has a lot of seating, great music, great coffee and plenty of electrical outlets!,The unfortunately named XTREME Bean company is actually quite a homey lil place. Located near Jo Anns fabric in what I refer to as a concrete island (meaning it is part of a strip mall, but not technically connected to said strip mall) with it's own mini-drive through, it is also across the street from Sunflower Market. 

At first it feels like a Starfucks rip-off, but the actually delicious looking pastries, cheap prices and staff with actual personalities changes that impression fast. A diverse crowd enjoys the brew here, all kinds of seating (esp. the rather weirdly inviting cubicle room for studying that reminds me of Real Genius for some reason...maybe it was the bearded guy in there), and plenty of outdoor seating.

My tasty bagel and decaf coffee with soy came out to under 4 bucks and was quite good.  With all the seating and good 'vibes' in this place, a great place for studying or procastinating on studying. 

You could bring your dirty hipster friend or your mom here-and that is a good thing.

***

NO TAXATION ON LACTOSE INTOLERATION

After a couple more times coming here, you know what?

Not impressed.

I don't like it. I can't eat anything, there is never any seating except in that creepy back room that is supposed to be a study area but always has people babbling away, and I am sick of the dirty hipster punks smoking their anarchy, corporate-sponsored lungs outside.

Final straw? I had an entirely unreasonable fight with a barista regarding soy! WTF? I ordered just a regular decaf coffee, and politely asked if they kept soy on the kiosk (you know the one with sugar and milk stuff), and she said they keep it in the fridge. I asked her if I could have some. I notice my total is wrong and go over the order again. Where did the extra 50 cents come in? ""Oh that is for soy."" ""Um, that is like a THIMBLE size of soy. I am NOT paying 50 cents for that."" ""Well, that is the rule"" ""What rule? Wildflower, Three Roots and a bunch of other places don't charge me to use a little bit of soy"" ""It costs extra to get soy."" ""I can get a full container of soy MILK across the street at Sunflower for a little over a buck. Would you prefer I just got a container there for that amount and brought it back with me?"" ""Soy milk costs like, over 3 bucks.."" (This statement is accompanied with an eye roll). ""Look, I am vegan (a white lie) and extremely lactose intolerance. I can't have milk. They don't get charged for milk. I am not paying that amount. Can I just talk to your manager?"" ""We don't like have one right now"" (I swear to god she really talked like this) At this point, some laid back guy just said, ""Dude don't charge her."" I thanked him, saying I wasn't trying to be difficult, but paying that much was ridiculous, and he agreed since he was vegan himself. 

I called back several times and never got a call back regarding the soy incident.

I know I sound crazy, but GODDAMN, I am sick of the lactose intolerance tax! Soy is hip! Everybody drinks soy! And you can get it cheap!

Xtreme jerks.,Great place to study, relax with a coffee and a book, or catch up with a friend over coffee. 

The coffee is very good and they usually offer several varieties at once. The pastry's are very tasty and never stale. 

The wi-fi is good and free, not super fast but certainly not slow. 

It does get a bit loud in the main room at times. When that happens the bank vault turned study/work area is still pretty quiet.,A bit disappointing as I thought this would be a more original place. No mugs? a latte spoiled by a horrible lid? Not the best start for me. I was looking forward to visit this place for long, but the first impression was not the best and I hardly think I would return. If you like chain crappy coffee you'll hate me, but if you crave an original expresso in your latte with that professional art....you'll understand me.,Great coffee for great prices! Can't go wrong there.,very good service, relaxed atmosphere, came here mid morning and there was no waitin too much for my order- coffee and a muffin.  a lot of people come alone, so seating can be limited- there is outside tables where u can sit as well.  ive been here for my first time few years, glad to see it still operating and no drastic changes noted :),Every time I get coffee from xtreme its always been an enjoyable experiance. Wether Im doing homework or enjoying time with friends, its a great atmosphere with great coffee!,I always get the same thing when I go here.  The coffee itself is great.

Just one thing that irks me.

The bugs in the display case with the food.  Not just living moths, dead ones too.

The coffee is really good though.,Recently moving back from the Land of Corporate Coffee Shops (California) i found myself looking for apartments that were close to the Xtreme Bean. yes i like this place that much! 
 free Wifi, Live Music, Cool outdoor seating, Plenty of inside seating (Compared to Starbucks) Pleasant workers, Hannah and Lauren are pretty cool people.
 Great place to chill with the laptop or just to meet friends... i have also made some new friends there.,I've been going to Xtreme Bean Coffee Company since Gold Bar days, and although the name has changed, the idea has not.  The coffee options are right on par with the big boy chains in the world, which I will not mention here.  The ambiance offers a great place to read a great book, to discuss have a study group, have a great discussion about politics or literature, all the while savoring the coffee and teas, and nibbling on the pastries and offerings.  It also has a drive through, which had the ",0.250026649
The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf,"It's funny how much more you can appreciate a place once you don't have to work there anymore. Such is how I feel about The Coffee Bean. 
I worked at this location for almost two years, and while I was miserable pretty much the entire time I still enjoy coming here for coffee. One of the reasons being, I love the location. Being a bit more off the beaten path, it caters to a more neighborhood-y crowd for being a chain. A lot more regulars and not as many tourists(except during Spring Training time which always made me especially suicidal when I was an employee). 
And the coffee is pretty decent. There aren't as many selections of flavors as Starbucks but I always thought the quality was better. I highly suggest trying the new Pecan Praline latte which is delicious, plus the blendeds are far superior due to them actually being BLENDED and not chunks of ice. 
The place closes at 7pm all week so it's not exactly a nighttime hangout. Of course when I worked there closing time was an annoying and unnecessary 9pm....it's nice the bastards finally get their act together AFTER I leave.
Oh and for all you guys out there, the place is next to Ford Modeling Agency so you can see models, yes real models, probably on their go-sees milling around carrying their little portfolios. It's very ANTM.,I drink simple brewed coffee, prefer dark, bold & rich. If a place doesn't have something like this brewed, I might order an Americano. Therefore, I judge coffee places on their.......COFFEE.

The Bean has GREAT brewed coffee.  They are fantastic with samples of whatever they have brewed, and I find there coffees very smooth. They are actually the only place where I sometimes ordered the day's flavored coffee; for some reason, their flavored actually tastes good to me with a little half and half, while most places taste like fake-flavored coffee, overdone on the additive flavor.

The baristas ALWAYS offer to make a fresh pot of flavored if it's past 11 and I'm interested in it. I think that's amazing... but I can't let them seemingly waste a whole new pot of it on me?  If I ever have to wait for a new pot to brew, they are always amazingly nice about it, no matter what location I go to.

I like the living room feel of this location, the couch, comfy chairs, and big ""conference"" type table. I also like sitting outside if it's not too hot; somehow I enjoy it out there, even though I'm looking at a parking lot & Chandler Blvd. Maybe the coffee is just that good to me...

I can run a card for that simple cup of coffee, which yes I have had to do before. They never give me any grief about it.  Love the company, period!,Four words: Red Velvet Hot Cocoa. Ah-mazing. Genius. Heavenly. Perfect for the chilly nights! I want a vat of it at my house!,I met someone here for a date and it provided an excellent atmosphere. The building was very spacious including outdoor seating, a couch area and plenty of tables & seats. It made it very easy to talk and get to know each other. 

My date indicated she didn't like hot beverages here as much as Starbucks - sometimes they are too sweet...instead we both went with an ice blended beverage, which closely remembled a frappachino at Starbucks. I went with the black forest which had chocolate, cherry and bits of expresso. I also saw other customers working on computers and meeting with groups. Definitely a cool spot to meet people or catch up on some work.,The African Sunrise Tea Latte with Soy Milk is a must when visiting this quaint establishment!  The service is great, and depending on what you are looking for, they'll suite your needs.,great chai lattes and this location is not busy in the evening!,I've been to this location twice and both times, not only did I receive stellar service but my coffee drinks were delicious as well.  The first time we went was to pick up some gift cards and we decided to get a drink.  I believe we were being served by the manager, who was quite knowledgeable and very friendly.  I also liked that while you wait for your drink (or just hang out) that they have a variety of board games that you can play.  

My second visit was just as good.  The employee who took my order was super-helpful, explaining what the new drink that they were sampling was.  My drink came without whip, though I think I ordered it with...though I'm not sure.  Either way, that's probably how I should get it, just to save some calories!  

I definitely will be back.  4.5 stars, rounded to 4.,Where do you go when you need to find FREE WI-FI? To coffee bean and tea leaf, especially with their many many locations all around town and their good selection of coffee and tea. 

This place was really easy to find on the corner of Miller and Indian School. The setup is nice with a few comfy chairs, lots of electrical plugs around the place and tons of seating. We ordered iced blended coffees. (They would be even better with BOBA in them, but I doubt they would accept the suggestion). They were very good and the guys working there were very nice. A good music selection playing and lots of yummy snacks to choose from if you are inclined. 

Definitely a place to check out for some good coffee or tea and FREE WI-FI.,First time at this location, NOT kid friendly! And what ever you do make sure your little one does not reach under the display case and touch the brownie! The not  so nice girl at the registrar will tar, feather and give you the stink eye all night. Drinks were fine service was unforgiving and uncomfortable.,I like this Coffee Bean only because it is tucked away on the corner of Miller & Indian School, so it doesn't get those huge workday morning lines that reach outside the door like most Starbucks do. Coffee Bean's drinks are far superior to Starbucks in my opinion, but that's why the price is so much more. I also think that Coffee Bean needs to work on its menu options because their pastries are just average. The baristas aren't that friendly here either, and the parking is kinda weird since it's located in a business complex. This is just your run of the mill Coffee Bean. Nothing special!,josh makes great caps,Two words...Hot Vanilla.  We get this every time we are in the area and it is amazing.  I can't really comment on the rest of the menu but i am sure that it is fantastic.,All Starbucks should be replaced by these joints. Although still a chain, they actually care more about their beans and don't char them. And their chai is not powder. It just sucks that they close at 8 on weeknights... Not a convenient place to sit and do homework.,This is my favorite coffee shop around. The staff are pleasant and the coffee is always made perfectly to order. There are plenty of comfortable chairs and even a couch to lounge on and of course free wi-fi. When it gets warm I love to sit outside and soak in the warm sun on the patio.,12/29/2011

Thanks & Goodbye,2.5 Stars (I'll round up because I'm in a good mood)

I came here for an iced coffee the other day because it was nearby and ended up paying around $4 for a medium iced coffee with caramel sweetening. Really? $4? I know I wouldn't even pay that much for a large iced coffee at Starbucks! Maybe I was mis-charged? I don't know. All I know is I thought it was an outrageous price. I don't mind paying that much for a latte or blended beverage, but just plain iced coffee? Come on! The coffee itself was delicious, but was it worth $4? Eh I don't really know.

The service was okay, though the barista did seem confused when I asked if I could get a flavor in my iced coffee. It's like getting a flavored iced latte but with all coffee instead of milk - what's the big deal? Apparently it was confusing. But whatever. This confusion is probably what caused me to get over-charged. 

Anyway...

I've only heard great things about Coffee Bean, so that and the fact that it's a less than 5 minute walk from J's will mean I will be returning for my necessary daily caffeine fix. Will report if I have a better experience next time. Fingers crossed!,Seriously, from their hazelnut ice blend, to there hot hazelnut latte, and to there vanilla or pomegranet blueberry hot teas; they remain awesome and great. Taste is always consistent, staff is always friendly, I wish I could live next door to this place!,over-priced, weak coffee, boring/awkward staff.,I've had good experiences here. Although I am not a coffee type of gal, the hot chocolate, or juice and muffins, do the trick for me. I usually meet clients here for early morning meetings and we can actually grab a table and hear each other speak. They also have a nice little shaded patio, a bit chilly in the months from November to April, but summer months... ahhhh!,I love this coffee bean and tea leaf... I was so excited when I moved here and drove by it. I was a little worried there wouldn't be one and i would only get it when I go to Malibu to visit family. 
The staff is super friendly I always get a iced non fat vanilla latte... Mmm super delicious best out of all coffee shops hands down,Coming from good Minneapolis independent coffee and tea, Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf was mediocre at best.  Coffee was watery and bitter.  The tea selection was impressive, but the workers were very resistant to make any of it iced.  This business seemed to be very corporate flaunting itself as independent with board games, books to read and free water.,I think three stars is a pretty generous offering for Coffee Bean, at least this particular one.  A previous reviewer mentioned there was plenty of seating but I think that it feels crowded inside this particular location.  I'm not a huge blended coffee guy, and it looks like that happens to be one of CBTL's specialties, but their espresso drinks are boringly average and slightly overpriced.  I've never been blown away by friendliness here either, and really only go when every other coffee shop is closed on Sunday afternoons.,Pretty good coffee. Nothing special but better than starbucks by far.,Their Ice Blended Pomegranate-Blueberry Latte makes my heart sing ;) 

For colder weather, you can get it hot with soy milk. For not so fancy days, you can get a regular Pom-Blue Iced Tea. Iced tea with a hint of flavor of the Pom Blue. Large one for $3. Yup, I wasn't kidding when I said I was in love with this stuff. I've heard their other teas were just as divine but I can't steer myself from trying them because usually when I'm at CB, I'm there for a Pom-Blue fix.,This place is awesome. The tea is way better than Starbucks and the coffee doesn't taste burnt. The manager, Debbie, is almost always there and is always very friendly and accommodating. I recommend the southern iced tea. It tastes like rose pedals with just a very slight sweetness.,Had an iced tea (mint mocha as recommended by the server) which was good. Modern coffee spot, a good alternative to Starbucks.,This location is really small frist off. Not a lot of seating room so get in early if you plan to stay! And plan to be cramped in! 

The staff was really friendly, but a little forgetful. 

All in all I always like The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. It's not a locally owned shop but you know it's quality when you are in an unfamiliar area and in need of that espresso fix!,Good location on SE corner of 75th Ave. & Bell.  This location has a convenient drive-thru for those who are on the go.  Nice to come here after shopping at the neighboring Old Navy, Cost Plus, or New Balance shoes.

Coffee & atmosphere are like most other Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf Chain locations.,Great outdoor and seating friendly staff,i love this place based on their outstanding tea lattes, especially the tropical passion tea latte. i've never had the coffee, so i can't speak about it but their tea lattes are absolutely delicious. they have tons of flavors, and the teas are definitely better than tazo. each and every tea can be made over ice, whereas starbucks can only do a few specific teas over ice unless you want to wait for them to brew one specifically for you.

they are extremely friendly and welcoming, and they've never gotten my drink wrong. not once. i'm so glad they have a location in chandler and at tempe marketplace, but i wish the ones out east were still open. :(,I used to come here all the time in the morning. That was back when I first moved to Arizona and didn't realize that this was just a California chain... I thought it was something new and different.
Then I decided to switch from frothy lattes and other mixed coffee drinks to Just Plain Coffee. And I realized that someone in the back kept seriously messing up the coffee. I don't know what it was, burnt or weak or old or something. So I mostly quit coming.
Once in a while I'll still drop in, but they do this thing which really annoys me -- when you ask for room for cream they leave like half the cup empty. I've had times before where my non-observant husband will get coffee for me, bring it home and it's honestly one-third empty because they left ""room for cream."" NO ONE uses THAT much cream, coffee bean, come on!,Pomegranate-Blueberry was recommended by the Barista and I must say I was very impressed with it!  Great tea and free wifi!,Decent drinks.  Plenty of seating and free WiFi, which is important since I'm usually going to coffee shops to be productive and do some work.  It doesn't really stand out to me in any way.  I've had hot coffee and iced coffee.  They were good, but nothing I couldn't get at other coffee shops for the same price and quality.  I'll be back because it's convenient to my house, but I could be just as happy with another coffee shop.  I'm not a tea drinker, so I can't vouch for the tea side of the house.,The staff is still great here, unfortunately some changes to their teas and coffee extracts forces me to lower they're rating. 

The new coffee extract is much more bitter than it used to be and leaves an aftertaste with an astringent quality. Yes, I actually feel thirstier after drinking an extract infused drink.

The company has also moved from whole leaf tea to cut leaf. The change has also resulted in a more bitter tea than before, more of a grass quality.

Their constantly changing menus are intensely annoying also.

Sad to say, if it wasn't for the great staff here - I'd probably just go to Starbucks for my quick fix coffee.,Great location, small space, ok selection...
While CB&TL is a decent chain, some locations are better than others and this is just not one of them.  I've been a handful of times to this CB&TL for meetings as well as stopped in to get a cup of coffee or tea before or after a visit to Triple Sports (it's right next door).  It's just nothing to write home about...
Last Thursday evening, I declared this would be a meeting spot for a group of us that needed to get together to discuss an upcoming event.  It was a 5:30 meeting and I arrived a bit early to get a drink and find a table for us.  Unfortunately, there are only 3 tables that sit 4 people... the rest of the tables sit 2.  There is a loungier area that seats maybe 4 in the back as well.  Luckily, one of the 4 tops became available as I waited, but if it didn't, we would've been SOL.  
I will say that I like CB&TL sugar free vanilla flavoring as well as their lemon FruTea drink - try it if you go, it's refreshing and thirst quenching... supposedly it's made from lemon extract which is why it has that tart flavor I love so much.  Overall, I can give this CB&TL 3 stars - I think that's actually pretty fair.,Dragon Jasmine hot tea is amazing,Not gonna lie, I choose this place over Starbucks. Mainly because it has such a cool ""Relax at home"" vibe. Good service, they always greet me as I walk in. Very clean.

I always dig the ice blended mocha...it's like crack.,The coffee here is exquisite and the bran muffins even though delicious a bit too big. so, you get more for your money? 
my favorite new place.
oh, and the speed of service is wonderful when  your on the run.,Can't go wrong with an iced gingerbread latte, hot waffle with Nutella spread and free wi-fi - especially shared with my beautiful wife. :),good fast service ez parking, big cookies,I come to this place for the tea. I love thier teas and the wide selection of them. I guess thier coffee is good too, but I'm not a decent judge of coffee.The atmosphere is great and I love sitting there with friends. It also helps that I live across the street from it. An amusing tidbit I found out is that that this place is completely Kosher.,My dog, the adorable DeeDee Anne and I enjoy their muffins, the Beautiful Carin enjoys their scones and they don't burn the coffee...what more could I need from a coffee shop on a gorgeous Sunday morning?!?!
Well, nothing really.
I don't require an awful lot for a Sunday walk in the park with my favorite people (I know, but my dog is people, too), just nearly perfect weather, great companions and a decent cup of coffee. The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf provided the coffee (and a reasonable muffin and scone), I had to find the rest on my own!
See you at the park!,Um, yeah, no!  Not!  I love coffee houses, but if one is going to go with corporate coffee I would rather hit my local Starbucks that The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf.  ""Simply the best?""  That is their motto, but I think not!  The artificial power they use in their drinks tastes nasty, and never fully disolves in either the hot drinks or the iced drinks.  There is always a nasty, sludgy mess in the bottom.  Plus the powder sticks in my throat and makes me cough.  And none of the employees know anything about the drinks.  They seen very disinterested.  If I am going to buy coffee I want it to be from a fun place.  If I want coffee with morning attitude I can make it at home, and experience by own bad attitude. This Coffee Bean has been a bad experience every time.  Hit the independent coffee houses, or hit the Coffee Beans older, and successful brother, Starbucks.  Why settle for second rate coffee?,I love this location. It is tucked away and surrounded by trees and hence shade and feels welcoming and inviting. The barista was super nice and made my large, iced hazelnut latte perfect. The store was very clean and just felt calm on a beautiful Saturday afternoon.,The coffee is mediocre and the Barista was openly rude to an elderly woman behind us. The only great thing was the small, shady patio facing the street. I guess maybe the appeal is that there aren't any other coffee shops around that area, with Jamaican Blue being gone. Granted, I don't know the area that well--my friend just works around there. 

But, across the street there's a place called Scratch that you should definitely check out. Best pastries ever. And the coffee's pretty good, too.,Given the choice between The Bean and the Bucks, I will always choose The Coffee Bean!  The coffee is better. The service is great. It's never as crowded. There are fewer children. (Starbucks might as well add a jungle gym....kids LOVE their lattes!). It's comfy. Plenty of outlets and free wifi. You can really get some work done. 

My only wish is for a drive thru.,Yum! I'd give 5 stars if they remembered that we also ordered a water, we had to ask for it twice, but the coffee is tasty to me.,Love Coffee Bean! I think it's a lot better than Starbucks. I love coffee, but I'm also a huge tea person, which makes this a great place for me! They have a great tea selection and I like how they always have a different kind out for you to sample and explore a little. The people at this location are really nice, too. As for coffee: I LOVE the ""Black Forest"" which is a blended coffee drink with cherries and chocolate-covered espresso beans, I can barely make it to my car before sucking down half of it! It is just so damn delicious :). Sometimes the tea can be a little watered down, but it has only happened once or twice out of the 30 something times I've gone there. Strawberry cream tea is zee best!,What can I say? It was the coffee bean in AZ! Was great.. worked just like it was supposed to and does in San Diego and Vegas. Nice work, now I love you in 3 States.,over priced. 
watery coffee. 
not strong at all. 

however, their frozen lemonade is amazing.,I'll admit it, I'm a trendy Starbucks fanboi. But when I'm feeling something different, Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf is good ol' #2. They have great coffee, the environment is quiet, modern, and very wooden. I usually drink the white chocolate mocha, its light and smooth. I like the ice CB uses - they aren't cubes, and they aren't crush. They're little spheres that chill at the bottom of your cup.,With so many great coffee shops in the Valley, this one is only just ok in my book. The location is decent and a good choice when looking for a nice patio to sit on or a quick cup o' Joe, but it fills up quickly. The staff is friendly as well. I'm not a huge fan of their iced coffee though. I ordered an iced mocha and watched them concoct it. They seem to use sugar free powder, add it to hot liquid and pour it into the coffee then add milk. Unfortunately, it didn't quite work for me and the iced coffee wasn't so iced and I tasted chunks of powder throughout. I've had their hot drinks though and their regular coffee is decent. I just wouldn't suggest going the iced route unless maybe you go the frozen route..now those are pretty tasty.,I have been going here for a few years now and in the last year or so I can say that I go about 4 times per week. I LOVE this place and I love the staff. I get either different Iced Tea that is not brewed so they specially brew it for me OR a Mocha and I have never had a proble with my drink here. The staff are always friendly and they are not ROBOTS like at othe coffee places I used to go to. I will drive out of my way to stop in because I enjoy this place so much....,I don't drink coffee but if you like tea then you should really be going here at the least.  They have whole leaf tea that is freshly and perfectly brewed.  Good selection too.

None of those darn packets!

Booo Starbucks.  BOOOO!

The staff is very helpful and patient.,I love Coffee Bean! And I love this one because they have friendly baristas who are very knowledgable and helpful.

I checked out this place last week and ordered some tea lattes and a mocha and everybody was happy with their drinks. And I bought some of their peach oolong tea to make iced tea with. So good!

Way to be amazing Coffee Bean. I want one in my neighborhood!,I know I reviewed this place less than a month ago, but I go here everyday! 

I always get the Caramel Ice Blended! It's the best drink I have ever tasted in my life. It has me totally addicted. 

I love this place and always go through the drive-thru, being that my doggie, Olive is always with me. It's great! Not only do they have dog treats for Olive every time I come, but they also give her a little side cup of whipped cream. She loves it and has learned to expect it everyday. Sometimes they even put caramel on top like one of the blended coffee drinks I get. They even know Olive's name and they are pretty much the only people she doesn't bark at because she knows she's getting her daily treat! 

The coffee is great and the staff is super friendly!,Nice, large CBTL. Great place, as usual. Prices were reasonable considering the excellent quality of the coffee. Fast, friendly service. Nice atmosphere. Not much to say about this place other than I wish I lived by one!,Great service great coffee great atmosphere....
I found this place in my hometown of Thousand Oaks CA....  
I wish they would come to Portland OR....
rock on Coffee Bean......,like I said before, this place knows how to make a GREAT hazelnut mocha,A welcome alternative to corporate coffee (read Starbucks). We stumbled on this place while shopping for shoes at the nearby TJ Maxx, and were pleasantly surprised. Although I normally take my coffee hot, during the Phoenix summer heat, I relented and got it iced. My double iced latte was perfect!

Next time I need a caffeine boost delivered like a swift kick to the melon, I'll stop here and dose again.,Iced teas....always perfect!,Had a great coffee there this morning. I really liked the location and the open-air feel of the place. It was very comfortable and easy to find. The coffee was good. I had the vanilla latte and it was a bit too sweet for me but the texture of the drink and the taste of the coffee was pleasant. The service was a bit slow considering it was not busy, but overall I had a very positive impression. I will definitely go there again, however, it is a bit pricey.....FYI.,Wonderful service and location!! Support our troops by using coffee bean.  You can purchase coffee or cups which will be sent directly to the troops with your hand written message!! Thanx coffee bean!,I heart Coffee Bean!  Loved you in Vegas, loved you in LA, and now loving you in AZ.  I normally drool over the ice blended stuff but I wanted to try the teas since my friend said they have a great selection.  My god-daughter was undecided.  The girl behind the counter let her taste a few samples.  That was cool!  I got the tropical ice tea.  She got the green tea apricot something.",0.31550606
Teavana,"WOW!  The teas are so good.  It beats all the teas that I have tried before.  I was a big fan of The Republic of Tea, I think I have 1 or 2 containers of every different types of tea (green, white, red, etc).  After tasting the samples and getting the White Ayurvedic Chai and Samurai Chi Mate, I am hooked on Teavana.  Thanks, M.  It is your fault!,This is a very cool tea shop they have all kinds of tea. The people that work there were ver well informed about tea and were able to answer all my questions. They have a very large selection of tea pots and steapers I went in and bought some Strawberry flavored tea I thought it was a little pricy but was very good tasting.,I resisted Teavana for a long time, but then I babysat  one night in CenPho and had practically the whole store's inventory for my sampling delight, and it was love at first sip.
The samples given out in front of the store are pure heaven. I need Youthberry white and Wild Orange Blossom herbal iced or I go through withdrawals. 
Monkey picked Oolong is also fancy shmancy. I'm not sure I have tried a finer, rarer tea than that. Either go monkey only or don't go monkey. Six Sumits Oolong is also special but it doesn't come close to the monkey. I haven't tried Thai Mtn or Phoenix Mtn, but now I want to. I drink Oolong teass hot, not a fan of any iced.
I normally don't need my tea sweetened, but their German rock sugar can't be passed up especially in the Pineapple Kona Pop herbal tea, iced.
The packages are pretty, the store itself is a truly a gift shop with something for everyone, and the customer service is top knotch.
Sigh...this store gets the best of me, bringing my tea addiction to a whole new level. 

Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it's very pricy for an iced tea to go- $4.99. I think it may vary on the tea you get, but still, twice the price of Starbucks iced tea in a smaller cup?  -_-,I tried Peach Momotaro (blooming tea) once and I have been addicted ever since!!  I can say I have been Tea-ed for 4 years now. Momotaro has a sweet honey-like peach flavor that isn't artificial tasting.  It's a bit on the expensive side but when I want so spurlge a little this is where I go.,Hands down, they have the best, strongest, tastiest teas. And they actually train their employees to know about all the flavors and benefits of each. The stores are all similar in their freakish cleanliness (they're opening in Fashion Square next week), but I suppose it's all about the zen, man. 

I've been ordering from Teavana.com for a long time, so when this Biltmore location finally opened, I rejoiced. I strongly recommend you try a blend of Queen of Babylon white tea and Rose Garden herbal. It's like drinking milk post Froot Loops, but packed with antioxidants!,Came in for a return and had the best time with Melissa.  she was very helpful in selecting some tea.  always love coming in here.,Beware the ladies of Teavana! I say this good-naturedly, but also as a warning. Let me say first that as a tea freak I love that this place exists, and now I can go to either the Biltmore or Scottsdale Fashion Square location. But here's what happened to me, and I repeat it here as a warning: I walked by the store with no intention of going in. Thirsty, I sampled a tea by the door, then another tea. Then I thought, what the heck -- I walked a few feet into the store and sampled another tea. That's when a lady of Teavana snagged me, chatting quite knowledgeably about the tea I was tasting and inviting me, like a Siren, to get a whiff from a tea canister at the counter. Expertly, she fanned the lid of the canister over the leaves so that I could get the full effect. Oh my, that orange-pomegranate-whatever smelled good. Must I take some home? Oh yes, I must. That lovely 8-ounce canister of herbal tea will be $36, please. Yikes!,I must admit.. Im not much of a tea person.. but a few weeks back while at Biltmore, the friendly Teavana girl gave my friend a sample of Jasmine Tea with a bit of strawberry essence.. I had a sip of hers.. all the while thinking.. 'Im not a tea girl'.. I walked away from that day wishing I had that tea.. So today, I decide to become a tea person.. I scored a beautiful Asian teapot and some of the best tea leaves ... Friendly service.. but that was from 'my' girl.. I didnt find the other two that friendly.. but I will add, they know their leaves.. now work on the friendly part when someone is dropping $20 on a small tin of tea.. and you have a 5,The employees at Teavana are really helpful and have this interesting way of letting you experience the teas: they take the lid off of the tea container and use it to waft the delicious tea scent your way. 

Their Sour Cherry Black Tea and the Raspberry Riot Lemon Maté are my favorites. (Maté has the same amount of caffeine as coffee, but doesn't give you the jitters.) The teas I've tried are extraordinarily flavorful and most are blends. Expect to pay $7.00 for a bag, so it's a bit of a splurge. But, because they brew so strong, they are excellent for iced tea. You can get a preview of the teas at http://www.teavana.com/,Uh oh...

I'm going to become a Teavana addict. Walked by...had some samples. Came back. Walked by again. Walked in this time. More samples. Helpful sales people to answer my questions. I want some. I know I don't exactly need it...but do people ever really come to shop at Biltmore because they need things? No. Biltmore is for extras. Teavana may be an extra, but damn it - it's a worthy one.

But I digress...

Next thing you know I've tried 5 different teas, loved them all, and walked out with my very own tea tin, two kinds of loose leaf, and another strawberry misaki ""blooming tea"" that is amazing. Seriously, go check out the blooming teas. It's a whole new ballgame.

Amazing selection. Super flavorful and unique teas. You may not be a tea person, per se. But after spending time here, you will want to. I'm primarily a coffee girl, but Teavana is already making a convert out of me!

Only 4 stars because tea really doesn't need to cost this much. I have always purchased pretty quality loose leaf teas from Peet's and it's a lot less than here. But like I was saying, people don't likely shop at Biltmore - orTeavana because they need to.,I have an addictive personality (shocker, I know) so when I hopped up on the proverbial ""wagon,"" I immediate sought out the quickest replacement I could find. Unfortunately, while skilled in the art of boozing, I am no tea aficionado and have been drinking bagged tea I got for $1.99 at WalMart. (I am sorry, Julia T, on so many levels)

The other day I happened to be trolling around The Biltmore infecting people with my excessively shiny good mood when I happened across Teavana and the lovely ladies out front providing samples of their Jasmine Dragon tea. 

Until this moment, I refused to believe that loose leaf tea could be that much better than the bagged tea, but let me tell you, I. WAS. WRONG. That is right, I am admitting, perhaps for the first time ever, that I was wrong about something.

I did not like having to spend $7 on my Teavana container (which is why I am docking one star) but I didn't mind the other $25 I spent on the tea because, let's just be honest, it is fucking delicious. And cheaper than booze. 

To cap off this lovely little experience, the gal who rang me up (and was sure to explain all about the tea to me!) ""forgot"" to charge me for the cup of brewed tea I asked for, so I got it for free. She was either pitying me for spending $35 on tea or she thought I was cute. Either way, I was happy to leave five bucks richer and immediately proceeded to spend it at the next designation. Money burns a hole in my pocket, what can I say?,Great tea but you'll pay for what you get.,These people are dangerous and they should be stopped! Somehow whenever I come in here, I walk out BROKE. But I have achieved enlightenment in the form of tea, so I guess I should stop complaining. Their salespeople know their tea, you can tell them exactly what you want from a cup of tea, and they can recommend a variety or blend that smells so good inside the canister you'll want to brew some up right there. Buy just a little though, because if you're like me, you'll end up with a cupboard full of shiny little bronze bags that date back to, oh, Christmas three or four years ago, and that's just a waste of good tea. I have a bad habit of overstocking when it comes to tea.,Hands down the best tea I've had was from here. There's so much flavor packed into each serving that you'll probably slap yourself for ever drinking something filtered out of a tea bag. The first time I came here I bought the cheapest one I could find and it was really good. Since then, I've come back for whatever they recommend. If you know your tea, this is the place to go.,Went to the one in Arrowhead mall ---- couldn't get any help even though there was four or five employees working - I was pretty grungy from work and felt they truly looked past me. I did finally get some help and then they kept trying to up sell me - first a tin, then more tea than I wanted etc ... I had to be pretty firm as to exactly what I wanted and what I was going to pay for. 3 stars only because the tea is yummy. I prefer Souvia tea on 7th street by a ton and will gladly drive further for Souvia's great customer service and helpfulness.  If teavana has a tea I just absolutely have to have - I'll order online or see if Souvia can get it.,When I moved here a few months ago I was sorry to see that this chain of upscale tea shops had not made it to Arizona. So, I was thrilled to see that one opened up in the Biltmore Plaza across from my office building. 

Teavana is a unique little store that sells, literally, hundreds and teas and blends as well as tea accessories. The staff is familiar with the product and can brew just about anything on premises, so you can try before you buy. The teas are high quality and there is something here for everyone. 

Also, they have great prepackaged gifts. I have given and gotten gifts from here and love it. I def. recommend the one cup tea maker they use in the store - it is an easy way to make one or two cups of loose tea at home without any mess and it is not terribly expensive. A good alternative for your caffeine fix.,Heavenly TEAS!! Snow Geisha!! Mates!! Fresh Teas, it's yummy, and I will never go back to bags and Lipton teas!!,I love this teas.  Yes, they are an indulgence.  At $25 a small bag, they are freaking expensive.  However, I got a couple of little bags on New Years day sale, so it was $20 for 2 small bags of tea.  The minimum you can buy is 2 oz.  My hubby was teasing me that you can probably get pot cheaper than that.  But what can you do, I love tea and never care for pot.  They sales people here are great at the up sale.  On word of caution, be clear with the sale information.  When they gave us the sample, they said: ""Oh, and this tea is at 75% off""  I thought score, but since it is a blend of two teas, the other one is not so once you go to get your bag, they tell you it comes up to around 40% off.  I did buy them because those two are my favorite ones and they usually don't have other great sales during the year.  At least I didn't spend $250 in teas like my girlfriend.,I went to the Biltmore today use a Saks Fifth Avenue gift card that I got last month.  I stumbled upon Teavana in the mall.  I was able to try several teas and was impressed by the selection and quality.  

I have been a tea aficionado since living in London, UK years ago while a student.  The tea mixes are unique, especially the Yerba Mate.  I figure that the prices are relatively high for the tea.  Each tea must be purchased at a minimum of 2 ounces which is about 50 grams; I only know tea weights by grams.  Albeit, that the mean price is about $10.00 per 50 grams and it takes approximately 2 grams to make a cup, it cost about 40 cents per cup which in about 2 to 4 times the amount I normally spend.

They have the finest tea accessories that I have seen in an actual store (not online).

I would have give a five star rating if the prices were more moderate....then again, it is the Biltmore.,I went to Teavana after my LuLuLemon shopping spree. The tea they leave out to sample was calling my name. GREAT TEA! Unfortunately I have not been able to reproduce the tea experience at my home. I am not a tea master, but I did read the instructions carefully. Now I am wondering if I actually bought the tea that I sampled...? I may never know. I found the store to be nice and welcoming, but like I said I think the tea person behind the counter gave me the wrong/or incorrectly mixed tea because it doesn't take the same. Hummmm. I will always wonder. I will continue to go back for samples:)",0.227463259
Steve's Espresso,"Took me a bit to find as it's just south of baseline facing McClintock (even though the address is baseline). Look for a big sign that says ""COFFEE"" and not so much ""Steve's Espresso"" :)

Small place, Good coffee, and a cool tea selection. I definitely will return to sample some of those teas.,Love this place - you can get a good ""hardcore"" coffee or a nice, tasty mocha. It also gets a nice blend of clients, and I never see it too full of hipsters or too full of laptops.

A great independent business - stop in and enjoy!,Iced latte and chocolate chip scone were both great!,I've only been here a few times, but every time I have, the atmosphere has been very chill and the service has been fast. I just tried their chai today- made by Steve himself. Don't be fooled by the fact your milk won't turn that pink/rust color- the chai is excellent. It's a little sweet, but very smooth with an even blend of spices. I hope to see a real spicy chai from them someday. Also had some of their espresso- very even flavors. Bravo. Barista was very knowledgable.,I woke up late one morning & did not have a chance to eat breakfast so my husband swung by my office & gave me a scone to eat. It was the best scone I have ever had, so I asked him where he got it & he told me it was from this little coffee house called Steve's. I had to go and check it out myself. I got there right after they opened (about 5:30 in the morning) so they were not really busy yet, but the guys behind the counter both greeted me & one took my coffee order and the other grabbed me a scone.  The service was really fast & I was in and out in 2 minutes, which was GREAT because I needed to hurry up and get to work. Once I was at work I was able to sit down & enjoy what I ordered. I got the French Roast which was nice & bold as advertised. They use a French Press to brew all their coffee which usually means a 5+ minute wait at any other coffee house (not to mention you have to specifically request it at other places), but because this is their standard method they already had it ready to go. But the coffee was not even the best part. They had 2 different kinds of scones today; Chocolate Chip or Cranberry Orange. So I picked the Cranberry one & it was delish! Their scones are flaky but still moist & perfect. The tart cranberries were just what I wanted in the morning with the sweetness of the scone itself & the strong cup of coffee. The sign up front also said that they make all their treats from scratch! Great little place to stop in the morning. This was the perfect start to my Friday! I will definitely be back.,I spend every Thursday evening at Steve's... and also maybe some time before finals... and after.
Its a really chill place to hang out. I love the music, the friendly atmosphere. Every Thursday the same group is there. The Bible study group in the corner, the students studying with their laptops, the loud Russian speaking club... oh that's us!
The vanilla syrup is their own creation. I have been inducted into the exclusive elite of those in the know, but I won't divulge. I can replicate that at home, but what I can't get a handle on is how to make such a smooth espresso. Their vanilla lattes are out of this world. I don't usually drink coffee, but I crave vanilla lattes from Steve's.
They have a nice selection of teas, but don't trust the little sniffer jars up at the front. I think they have not changed the tea in those little bottles for at least a year, but the tea served to customers is fresh.
I'm living one latte to the next.,It is just dismal those few times you want something to eat at the coffee house, and your choices are sad breakfast offerings or overpriced bakery items.  But I am vouching for Steve's food!... bacon, jalepeno & cheese frittata (w/ thin sliced potatoes as the bottom layer) as well as the ham & cheese stuffed brioche!  You do have to heat yourself.. luckily the microwave does have power settings, so go PL-7 or 8 to avoid overcooking as you heat.  

These guys are open early (5:30am M-F and 6:30am S-S)... so this is going to be my new go to place to grab some food when I have an early morning  flight or roadtrip.,Good coffee at excellent prices.  Steve is nice, ask him about the Economy when you stop by.,I forgot how much I like this place! Great coffee, great service, and AWESOME PEANUTBUTTER COOKIES....mmmmmmmmmmm!!!!!!!!!

I love that they have a ton of loose teas to choose from, and their coffee is smooth and delish as well (coffee is ALWAYS better made in a french press!). The barista told me they get some of their teas from their roaster and from tealux (have to research that one) They offer soy and almond milk options, for us anti-dairy folk. They have housemade cookies and pastries and fritatas. They only thing, with the fritatas, you have to reheat them yourself in a microwave (personally, I prefre made-to-order food).

I don't know if it's true with all the cookies, but at least I know the peanutbutter cookie is gluten and dairy free, though not vegan (contains eggs). Great service.....the barista even texted his boss for me to verify what ingredients are used in the cookies. Nice guy!

Great coffee shop for the area! I'm a fan :),Great Americanos. The espresso beans have a great balance, and the atmosphere is upbeat. I live in the area and think this is one of the best, authentic places to get coffee.,Good morning coffee :)  I live about 2 blocks from Steve's and I find myself stopping by occasionally before work. As far as I know the owner opens the cafe around 6ish in the morning? I don't really know, seeing as how i need my coffee in order to communicate and I am usually running out the door on my way to work. Drinks are great, the place is clean and the tea selection is outrageous. I have never had a complaint about steve's and I don't think the future will bring dissatisfaction either.,This is the best coffee in this part of town. The coffee is roasted locally, and always ""pressed."" It does make a difference!

The atmosphere is very laid back, it's never too crowded and unpretentious doesn't begin to describe its feel.,Steve's has great prices for some of the best coffee in Tempe. The space is warmly decorated and inviting, perfect for an after-dinner cup of coffee with friends.

They make their own food and pastries here every day as well. Try their brioche!,I've been going to Steve's for years now, and I can't believe that I haven't reviewed it here... I really can't say enough good things about them.

Their coffee is wonderful, never bitter or sour. My personal favorite is the Aztech Mocha. 

The staff is so friendly, and almost always recognize me. I feel like even when they're busy, they take the time to talk to me. Whenever I'm hesitant about a drink, they assured me that if I didn't like it, they'd make me something else. 

Their food is mostly handmade and always very good. 

I really do try to visit the smaller, independently owned business in my area, since it seems that Phoenix is so corporate. I will absolutely go out of my way to visit Steve's -- and that says a lot since there are many competitors out there.

(on a side note, the only drawback of Steve's is that I cannot tip when I use my credit card. The staff almost always deserves a tip and I feel like a jerk when I don't have any cash),I love Steve's.  Having been here twice now, I feel safe with my conclusion.

Steve's Espresso is tucked away on the side of an obscure strip mall in Tempe.  Most don't even know it is here, which is perfect for an increasingly anti-social nerd like myself.

The atmosphere is a little bit different, too.  While it is like most coffee shops, it is a bit simpler and the music is a bit different.  All of which add to my liking of this place. 

Let's not forget the coffee.  While I can admit I may have had better coffee at other places, the espresso at Steve's is very delicious.  And for some reason, I have noticed their Mocha tends to give me a bit more motivation than most places.  

I thank @bwilley for having a meeting with me here, because it is now a new fav.,I like the simplicity of this shop and the coffee is great : ),Awesome little place. Freshly brewed coffee and tons of teas. Really friendly service too. I hope to see the atmosphere spiced up a little more (ie paintings, photos, or any other sort of art).,Nice, little spot we stopped in today after having lunch at Pasand. The employee was very friendly and decor was standard of a coffee shop. Despite being full from Indian buffet, I can't help but try baked goods in a new spot. For me, this was a soft-baked Snickerdoodle, that was good. I also had a small, non-fat pumpkin latte (yes, non-fat with the cookie!) that was equally enjoyable. For a total of 2 cookies, a juice box, latte, double espresso, and small italian soda, it came out to a little over $10. Not too shabby.,Awesome coffee, I got an iced coffee and it was pretty delicious. It was strong but very low in acidity, which is always the way I prefer an iced coffee. I also ordered the veggie frittata and took it to go. I was really impressed with the frittata, it was light and fluffy and the veggies were crisp even after I reheated it. 

I try to support local whenever I can and I am really happy my friend suggested this place instead of Starbucks. Fast and Fresh and Free Wi Fi!,My first time at Steve's Espresso.

I love Steve's!  Cool & funky atmosphere.  Funky music.  Good prices.  Funky barista.  What isn't improved if you rub a little funk on it?  

I had a ham & cheese brioche with my iced decaf.  Surprisingly good!  The filling was nice and not scrimpy.  The pastry pocket was flaky and delicious with a nice rosemary flavor.  Good light lunch!

Can you say free wifi?,great drinks. Good prices. BUT YOUR HOURS MAKE ME WANT TO DESTROY YOU.,Been to Steve's a few times.  Time for a review.  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)

+ Good ambiance.  Low lighting and sweet music.  I really enjoy studying here.

+ Slightly above average coffee.  I've had better, but Steve's still has really good drinks.

+ Awesome prices.  I'm in college and I really like saving my money.

-/+ Customer service is alright.  One time I was there only one barista working.  He was obviously a high school student and had other important things going on.  Two of his friends came in and chatted him up at the counter... and they weren't quiet.  Then, he left the counter, with no one else there, to go outside for a smoke and talk with his little friends.  Nothing happened in result, but I thought it was rude.,I've been here 4 or 5 times. The french press is what I have purchased all of those times, and its excellent. Smooth tasty cup of joe, at a cheap price, and a great atmosphere. I'm not one to loiter around coffee houses too long, but if I were to do a little bit of loitering this would be the place to loiter. They have a great selection of teas, as previously mentioned. Steves is recommended.,Steve's is in my Baseline & Guadalupe neighborhood, and I have come to rely on their ultra smooth french press coffee.  A mellow coffeehouse that isn't packed with hipsters who stand around outside smoking.   Wonderful place for actually reading.  A great independent Tempe business...  don't go to Starbucks in Tempe when you have so many other choices.,While I was enjoying all the coffee shops in Phoenix, everyone needs to find a good coffee shop near their house for those days you are in a time crunch or feeling a little grouchy. In Tempe, Starbucks seems to reign and while I like Xtreme Bean's coffee, the ambiance still feels a bit corporate. While checking out New Time's Best of, I got an idea for Tempe. Behold, the winner of best new coffee shop in Tempe for 2005-Steve's! I loved the fact they do french press coffee instead of drip, my prefered method as well.

Tucked into a corner of a strip mall (of course) of McClintock and Baseline, there was ample parking. There were some guys chilling out at the steel tables with umbrellas outside the cafe, smoking and reading books. Indoors, the rust orange colour was pretty soothing as were the wooden floors. Some small tables and chairs and lounging furniture scattered around the front of the cafe. Great artwork on the walls. The counter was inviting and had a lot of good looking, fresh pastries. The owners were there, chilling out and training a new barista and recommended the American iced decaf since they didn't have decaf iced coffee. It was delicious with soy and it cost under 2 bucks and it was a pretty big sized cup! I found this place to be one of the friendliest, cleanest coffee shops and I liked the magazine and newspaper selection. I went outside to enjoy my coffee, even though it had a view of the parking lot (I am getting used to this aspect of Arizona life) at one of the tables. I can see how this shop slipped under radars due to location, but really worth a try if around the Tempe area.,Locally roasted beans. Really great espresso. French pressed coffee. Made-from-scratch baked goods. Servers know coffee. Fun jazzy soundtrack. Free WiFi.

What more do you need? I've been going to this place on and off for ten years, and their espresso has always been among the best. I just wish I would've been smart enough to buy a house closer by!,Good coffee, good tea, nice seating--music can be kind of loud though. 

I really like their Buckingham Palace tea, with bergamot (Earl Grey flavoring) and jasmine. However, their pot of tea is the smaller than a large, but costs more. I forget this every time I get it, but maybe they're supposed to refill it or something ... 

The prices are pretty reasonable in general, like 2.50 for a cappuccino/latte. 

I like the seating, tables, comfy chairs, usually I can get my pick. Also, can't beat the free wi-fi! A good place to study/meet/or just get a good drink. The baristas are really nice too.

Oooo and they have good pastries mmmmmm,Best coffee in the valley!! And the pastries a-mazing.,This place is lovely. Local. Affordable. &&Quaint.

I don't go out for coffee very often, but when I do I always end up coming back to this place. They have pretty good Chai Lattes and it's a GREAT place for business matters. The staff knows what they're doing and are very friendly. Plus, they have french press coffee for all you coffee snobs ;) and fresh baked goodies that are quite delicious.

Definitely Recommend.,Ok, so I finally found this place!  Tucked away in a little strip mall across from some car dealerships, its a great little find.  I noticed that they have great hours here, open early and late at night as well.

The seating here is great.  Could accomidate a group as long as its not super busy, and they seem to have a decent menu of sorts.  I really like this place, and the guy at the counter who helped me was nice and funny.  Worth a stop to grab some coffee, read the paper, or surf the internet.,Went back to this place.  Internet was still awful.  Can't watch any videos.  Mocha is really good.  But they lost a customer for good.  You're a coffee shop, and people come here to study.  If you can't provide adequate internet, then that's a problem, and a foolish one on the owners behalf.,In the last year, they've made a few changes that really killed this place for me.  

First, their supplier of pastries must have gotten uppity with them because the size of their excellent pumpkin muffins has been halved.  And yes, the price has remained the same.

Second, they've decided to close at 8pm now.  As a student who needs a place to study until at least 10, this is totally unhelpful to me.,I was pretty disappointed with Steve's Espresso.  Considering its moniker, you'd think the espresso would be good here.  It wasn't.  My espresso was bitter and a touch sour.  It was drinkable, but that's hardly a recommendation.  

I tried one of their breakfast pastries, with cheese, bacon, and egg.  I was even less impressed with that.  I was surprised when the cashier handed it to me and told me I should go microwave it myself in an oven they have by the door.  I was told to put it in for 45 seconds.  I figured they would know their business and trusted what I was told.  After I left I decided to sneak a bite while stopped at a light.  The thing was ice cold in the center.  Great.  A bacon, egg and cheese-icle.  Even the part around the edge that was warm wasn't that great.  The dough tasted like it came out of a tube.  I probably would have been better off with something else.  There were several baked goods in the case that looked amazing.

The person that helped me seemed really nice, so I kind of feel bad giving the place such a hard review.  Honestly, most people would probably be happy with the drinks here, especially if you're the sort that pumps a bunch of sugary crap into your drink. 

According to a sign on the door they specialize in French press coffee, so ordering that might be a better bet.  But if that's the case, why doesn't he call the place Steve's French Press Coffee?  Either way, I won't be risking another stop here.,tried going here on new years day.  was met with ""closed"" disappointment,  but i should have known better.  i'm glad i went back as this was my 1st trip to steves, tho surely not my last.  i took  picture of the delicious  aztec mocha .... a big cup of love as my roommate said.  and the breakfast brioche was tasty.  plus a snickerdoodle ... not a bad way to start your sunday.  the staff were really friendly and i'm sure could hold court on any conversation.  the music was laid back and loud enough to enjoy and still soft enough to speak to one another.  in a nutshell, it's always fun to find a cool coffee shop, and this one goes down as one of the coolest.  i'm guessing i am late to this discovery....  what has kept me away?  might make it a staple from now on.,My husband and I really like this place.  We live in the area and are happy to have a locally owned place to grab a coffee and snack (I LOVE the bacon & jalapeno frittatta and the chocolate chip scone).  Their iced soy caramel latte is much better than any soy drink at Starbucks or Coffee Bean and very fairly priced.  There are always a handful of people there when we stop in but never crazy busy...which means we never have to wait long to get our fix :),The problem with North Tempe is it's dominated by large chain restaurants and Starbucks. Steve's Espresso breaks the mold and is the boutique coffee shop and lounge I've been looking for. They have the best coffee, tea, and fresh made pastries in all of Tempe. It's in an unassuming location and you've probably driven passed it a thousand times and didn't even know it was there. Make a point to stop by and I promise you wont be disappointed. My favorite is a Mocha with Almond Milk, no whip, and a Chocolate Chip Cookie. So good.,This is a great little shop.  Love the aroma of fresh coffee beans.  Many different flavors from which to choose.  Great relaxing atmosphere and few comfy chairs as well.  And free internet.  Definitely recommend.,Added bonus: Get the scones early (before 7am) and they are still warm. Yummm.,Thanks to all of you yelpers before me who wrote such great reviews about Steve's Espresso... and thanks to Alicia B. who suggested we have a bookclub meeting here too.  Otherwise, I never would've ventured out to McClintock and Baseline in Tempe.

Not sure what else I can say other than what a great find this is... I can't speak to the coffee, but the iced tea was refreshing on a beautiful afternoon like today.  It was clean, unassuming, although there were a good amount of people there, it was quiet enough to concentrate if you needed to get work done...  there was a good energy in the air!  Drew was working the counter and was friendly - both in the store and when I called to make sure they were dog friendly (which they are if the dog stays outside).

I didn't check out the restrooms which is surprising, but I'll have to do that next visit!  I'll also have to try some of the scrumptious looking snacks... Since they are open until 10pm every night of the week, maybe I'll go hang one evening soon!  Like Alicia, I only wish it were closer to my work/home.  Do you hear that Steve?  How about a 2nd location?,Love moca and breakfast!,Best feature: The Vibe

Alright, so I'm a Barista at another coffee shop and I've decided to review every coffee place except my own.  That being said, Steve's espresso is one of my favorite's at the moment.  Actually, it's kinda becoming my standard first date place(I think the Baristas are giving me the ""I know what's up"" look).

Their lattes are great; smooth and palpable.  At night (where most of my experience lays, ha) they play these sleepy grooves that you just barely notice.  The art on the wall is Arizona twilight meets shiny 8th grader art project - I love it.  

The Barista that I usually get is pretty cool.  He's really quiet and a great shot puller!  I think his name is Drew.,I started liking this place after I tried the iced Aztec Mocha.  Strong and delicious with a taste of mexican chocolate and cinnamon.  I've tried hot coffee and it's smooth.  Tried the iced chai latte and it needed sugar, I guess I was expecting something closer to the Starbucks, like really sweet.....

Have had their bacon/jalapeno frittata and it's sooo good.  Not at all spicy like I thought, but definetely a taste of chile with some chunks of potatoe and chunks of cheese.

Never mind my sweet tooth, I enjoy supporting this local place.  The barista is always so nice and quick!  Haven't tried the teas because I'm intimated by all the different selections.  I agree with another post, the sign does remind me of FreddyKruger too!! :)  Sometimes I worry their location doesn't give them enough justice to how great this little place is.,I always look forward to stopping here and getting my caramel macchiato!!!,Good coffee good atmosphere and a good place to meet up. 
I like finding these quaint hidden independently owned coffee houses they are great! 

The staff is great since whenever I come in I am only half mast and they must decipher what it is I am trying to request. 

Give them a shot (no pun intended) they are worth it!,I've visited Steve's espresso once, but the cute bistro made the best Dirty Chai I've had in a long time!!!  The atmosphere of the place is great and cozy, and the drink selection looks amazing! Next time I go I'm gonna try the Aztec Gold(or something like that) a chocolate spicy mocha that looked delectable!!  They're kinda in the corner of a cheesy strip but worth the drive for a good priced coffee drink!,Unpretentious. Friendly. Inviting. Warm decor and soothing music. This is the first local coffee house I found when i moved here a year ago. It was an oasis, a hidden gem in a shopping plaza. My only complaint is that there's nothing else around worth doing, so you can't grab an ice chai (my favorite; with 1 shot espresso), a conversation and hit the road. You either have you chill in one of their comfortable chairs or sit outside on the make-shift patio. Works for me, unless you get antsy. 

Bonus - Free Wifi. And the people there are no way obnoxious. No loud conversations or annoying cell phone calls. 

If you like tea, you can buy some here. They boast a wide selection that even the most decisive tea drinker may have trouble deciding! 
MONKS BLEND = Oh so good!

I only wish it were closer to my work/home.

And for you carb lovers, try the Pumpkin Muffin. It's fantastic!,I miss you Steve's Espresso. You were in my old hood, and I used to visit you frequently.  Now I am without a great local coffee shop with free WIFI.

Steve's has great tea and espresso drinks, I've tried both. Comfortable seating is all over the place. I could go there and get work done in peace. It has a very chill atmosphere and the employees were always super cool. Even the bathroom is nice. 

I really enjoyed our time together Steve's Espresso, and I am sorry I had to leave you.,Got a double espresso after a long day. Good coffee!! The color scheme is warm and inviting. The food is ok, if it was better id give it 5 stars. Stellar pick for coffee though. I do wish it was open later!!,#2 in Phoenix for me. They are very close, have GREAT coffee and espresso, and also great staff.,I went there for the first time today and got an iced honey-vanilla latte and I was impressed. I'm not a fan of espresso drinks that are too sweet so I was hesitant, but this was great. Just sweet enough, but I could still taste the espresso. I also got a cranberry orange scone and I will definitely be going back for more of those! It was packed with cranberries and was just overall tasty.,After reading all of this hype I was expecting Amazingness x 100!!!

I have passed by this place so many times and have never seen it from the street. When I entered I was expecting that warm sense you get from the pictures. I was a little disappointed to say the least.... It looked like a dimly lit cave and they had these weird blue lights on the ceiling that made me feel like I was in a pet store in the reptile section.

The barista was friendly and nice. He made me a giant Carmel Macchiato iced. It tasted pretty good although the choice in cup made me feel like I was at someones house making a smoothie for the pool. 

This place was alright, but it definitely didn't have that cozy alive feeling that the pictures showed. If you needed to study and wanted something low key this is great. I think I'm going to stick to Extreme bean and Solo cafe for now.,Friend was headed to Steve's Espresso before heading into work, now I have given up drinking coffee at the beginning of the year, so I can't give a testament to how great the coffee taste (yes Starbucks has been calling because they do notice how much I used to spend their) but I asked my friend to pick me up something sweet, she brought me 2 chocolate chip scones! 

Let me tell you they were delish! I was doing paperwork while eating my scones, and keep thinking man this is good stuff, the chocolate chips were nice & firm and the scone was sweet and moist, sometimes I have had scones that where dry and in need of coffee or tea to help finish them down! But these scones are top notch! 

I was rather sad :( when I noticed they were all gone, did I really just eat both of them!! Dang it!!! Have to go back and get more!!,Steve's Espresso was recommended to me by a friend one day as I was on my way to work before Solo Cafe opened and desperate for some heavenly caffeine. When they told me where it was I almost didn't believe them, as I drive past it every day and never knew it was there. It's pretty hidden and the main sign doesn't have the name of the business but just says coffee I believe. 

The coffee is pretty good. I have come to love the aztec mocha. I also appreciate that the cups are already insulated thus eliminating the need for the crazy cup holder/warmer thing that doesn't really work at all and keeps falling down.

The atmosphere is fairly plain. I believe they have free wifi, but to me it feels like just another establishment I'd stop in quickly but not be inclined to stay at. I'd love to see a more inviting feel. I'd probably stay and have more coffee instead of getting mine to go.,I like Steve's. The sign is wierd and I get visions of Freddy Kruger when I pass the place, but the coffee is good. Local stuff. The place is good for working.

First time I went in I got kinda ""my sh*% don't stink"" kinda vibe from the barista. It is kinda offputting, so I stayed away for a bit, but have gone back and haven't had any issues.

I prefer Solo down the street, but when I am here and it's convenient, I go to Steve's. Good coffee, good workspace. The end.,Coffee is OK, people nice. Always desolate,though.,I'm going to try and not over-state it here.  

I love Steve's Espresso.  

Maybe there are fancier coffee shops out there.  I'm not going to say this is the best Coffee shop in the world.  But it *is* the best one I've been to in this area and I've tried quite a few.

The atmosphere is decent, though I always find it to be a little warmer and louder inside than I'd prefer, but that's just my opinion, it's not too bad at all.  

The service is always good - there is usually one of two guys working the espresso machine, and they are both great - super friendly, make good drinks and they make those good drinks fast.  

Free wi-fi here as well.  

I've been all over the menu to try most of the drinks they have.  I like my drinks strong, but not bitter or over-roasted...and Steve's never disappoints.  I've yet to have a bad experience here.  My wife, however, found one drink and will never stray - the Aztec Mocha -- it's delightful.  

The pastries are also pretty good too -- yes, they are made before you get there.  Yes, you warm them in the microwave.  But they are not half bad.  Sure there are fresher options in the world.  But these are decent for sure.  Personally, I get the breakfast brioche...a lot.  

The scones are excellent as well.  The orange/cranberry one in particular.

They also have a pretty good looking selection of loose leaf teas as well -- I'm not a big tea guy (except when I'm sick), so I haven't tried any of the teas...but I will some day.

I could go on and on.  But if you're in the Tempe area and need a coffee...skip Starbucks and gives Steve's a try.,I live right between here and Solo Cafe (another nearby coffee shop). I always end up going to Steve's when I need to get work done. They've got bigger tables and a generally more mature clientele. They also play some good music, which unlike Solo, is relaxing and easy to work to.

And not to mention the coffee... it's the best in town. They french press every cup, which I love. The refills are cheap, unlike Solo.
I haven't tried the food, but it looks great and always tempts me.,This is my go-to coffee house in Tempe.  I love that they offer almond milk and their mocha is delicious.  By the way, if you haven't ever had an almond milk mocha, get one here.  I was actually here this morning at 9:30am and they were out of almond milk, but I'm sure that was just a glitch in the matrix.

I also appreciate the seating they provide.  There's a good number of tables and chairs and couches inside, as well as a few tables out front.  It's the perfect spot for a quick meeting, a quiet place to catch up on emails, or just enjoy a cup of joe.,Sorry Steve! I feel kind of guilty, but I have come here two or three times in the last couple of weeks due to it's somewhat close proximity to my living area..... each time has been worse and worse. I still haven't tried the food, which still looks super good! I did, however, try some different coffee drinks. I tried the mocha coconut iced and the aztec mocha iced. Both were appalling. I could not finish either. The coconut tasted WAY too sweet and a little chemical -ish. The Aztec was okay at first.... but slowly became cloyingly sweet as well.... maybe it's the chocolate they use? It was totally unpleasant. The Barista's have always been nice enough, and the space is nice, but man. The coffee just isn't there.....",0.339270562
Starbucks Coffee,"If you ever imaged a Starbucks that smelled of sweat socks mixed with caramel and coffee, you've come to the right place..

The Starbucks on Mill is easily the smelliest Starbucks in town.  The coffee is still decent because its a Starbucks, but the place just is not great.  I do enjoy the couches when people aren't living on them for 8 hours at a time.  The place is usually packed with people using laptops for the free wifi, and the smell comes from the people off the streets walking in and out of the place.  Dont forget.. t his is Mill Ave.. so all walks of life come here.

Enjoy!,I mean it's a typical Starbucks, nothing really stands out about it.
The drive through isn't the quickest, but the baristas are always very  friendly. I am grateful for the drive through either way, because some other Starbucks that are convenient to my routes don't have one! 
Also, since it's in a rather busy stretch of Bell Rd, it's easy to forget it's there. Look for Pei Wei, and keep heading towards Greenway Pkwy.
My order has never been wrong, so that's also a plus.
I get iced green or passion tea 90% of the time, green tea frap with soy the other 10%, always tasty!,I'm not a coffee person so I always end up getting tea. But, place was quiet, clean, and friendly. What more can I say - it was a Starbucks?,This is my favorite starbucks. They always get my drink right and every one is so friendly there! even the customers =],Very very slow drive thru

Recommend going inside,I'm not a Starbucks regular, but I was with friends who wanted to go here for breakfast. To be fair I've never once had a good experience at any Starbucks, and this was no exception. To me, Starbucks is always crowded, noisy, and has slow and rude service. Overall too stressful for me, if I want coffee I want a relaxing experience.

On this trip, I ordered a breakfast sandwich, whichever one was featured in all the pictures on the menus. I asked for it to have turkey bacon instead of regular bacon. This totally confused the barista who for some reason thought I wanted two sandwiches. We got our stuff to go and getting outside was like a blessing as it was so much quieter outside.  I opened my package and found a completely different sandwich from what I ordered. My friends then explained that Starbucks doesn't customize sandwiches for customers and what I got was a sandwich called the turkey bacon. I have no clue why the barista couldn't have explained that to me instead of just giving me the wrong thing. there are no signs indicating this and as a non-regular I wouldn't have known. My friends couldn't explain it to me at the time of ordering because the store was so noisy and loud they would have had to scream at me. The sandwich I received was bland and I only ate a small part of it before throwing it out. The only other item I got was from the cold case, so they couldn't screw that up because I picked it myself. But yeah, apparently ordering one item is too difficult and they will screw it up.,No need to discuss the menu, we all have our favorite...such as a carmel frapp for me.  But I have to mention the service at this location.  Normally, I frequent the drive-thru.  They have never given me an incorrect order and they are super friendly.  Inside is very well maintained and the seating outside is nice.  I love my local starbucks!,I don't know how many THOUSANDS of dollars I've spent here, but I simply cannot spend another 15 minutes in their drive-thru. It's just way too slow. This location is off my list.,I love this Starbucks! It's as close to a neighborhood coffee place this part of Phoenix has. The staff there are always super friendly & chit-chatty w/ me (which I adore) & never had an issue w/ my orders. I tend to order different things a lot, & so far so good. The Vanilla Scones are yummy, I must say.,If you hate people who are really cheerful early in the morning, do not come here; it is staffed by the brightest-eyed and bushiest-tailed baristas I have ever seen. For me, at least, the positive and pleasant interaction with other humans is as much of a pick-me-up as the coffee. I can't speak for the other patrons.
Otherwise, a Starbucks is a Starbucks is a Starbucks.,The people are great. Always friendly, always smiling. There's a drive-through too, sometimes the line can be a bit long, especially early mornings between 730 and 830.,One of the better ones in town. Quick, friendly, consistent quality.,Some of the best service of any Starbucks - reasonably fast with an upbeat smile to help start my day on the right foot.  Has some of the ""local"" coffee shop vibe to it, even though it is a chain.,Irony at its finest. I pulled into the drive thru of this location knowing I would write a review, since everyone knows if you use their drive thru you have time to kill, and I was surprised by how quickly things moved today. The line was fully stacked to the end of the entrance and I managed to make it through to get my 2 drinks and a bagel all by the time I was done writing this review from my phone (about 7 minutes.....minus the extra minute + the girl in front of me took with feeling the need to socialize with an employee in the drive thru line....). Hopefully this is a sign that 20 minute drive through runs are a thing of the past an they will keep this up. For now, 2 stars....keep your butts in gear with less wait time and this location could certainly jump a few stars. Time will tell.,This is my go to location on the way to work. They are open super early and in the same direction that I'm travelling. I hate going out of my way.  The staff is very friendly and informative about their product offerings.,The place lacks a bit of regular cleaning, both inside and outside. The cashiers has a tendency to do personal conversations during hours. Far for the best best Starbucks I have been to. Maybe service is better from the drive-thru?,This was my 3rd time coming to this location in about a year. I came with my friend Jess after a movie. We both got the caramel brulee frappucino. She got the chocolate croissant & I wanted to try the vanilla bean scones but they were out, again. So I got the marshmallow dream bar & iced lemon pound cake. This was my 1st time eating outside though. The tables were all a bit dirty but it was a nice day to sit outside & chat for a lil. 

I docked a star for being out of stuff & the outside tables being dirty.,There's two Starbucks locations in Terminal 4, both of them with huge lines. The staff did their best to keep the line moving and the drinks coming, but I think management needs to add another location here...,There are now 2 Starbucks now at Phoenix airport. The lines does get very long especially after lunch but the staff always seem to be friendly and do thier best to get everyone the coffee fix. I really enjoy my Americano coffee while waiting for my flights.,It was a rainy Saturday, yes, that's right, it was raining and hot and muggy!  UGH!  But when it rains I just want to go sit in a coffee shop and people watch or just relax a little.  And I don't have a coffee pot at home right now.  Yes, I know, it's somewhat sacriligious for someone such as myself who is a caffine addict.  Sad, but true.  I just needed my fix and it's that time of year people.....the Pumpkin Spice Latte is BACK!!!  HOORAY!!!  It is my all time favorite!!

This is the closest Starbucks to where I live.  Just a few blocks away.  When my friend took me here the first time she told me it was the ""gay"" Starbucks.  Yup, I think that is safe to say.  I'm straight but if I were gay, dang, I'd probably be here more often.  I like this location though.  It never seems to be super busy and there is always a place to sit weather it's inside or out.  It's clean and the staff are friendly.  It also helped that I was cleaning out my wallet and found a Starbucks gift card.  Score!  

There is not much else located near this Starbucks.  The Good Egg, which looks like somewhere I might try, and Jamba Juice but sadly, it looks like just about everything else has closed up in this little strip mall.  Too bad because it must have been a hoppin place a few years back.  

I may have to go back soon......like, today, maybe....I'm getting another craving for my fave PSL!!!  YUM!!  And now they have a PSL Frap!  I have not tried it yet but I will.  Sounds like pumpkin pie through a straw!  Yum-O!,I'm a fan of the caramel macchiato, both hot and cold. 

When I worked in Culver City, the closest Starbucks was hit or miss when mixing this drink.  I often got one on the bitter side.

Served by smiling, friendly baristas in the Phoenix airport, I was happy to receive a delicious grande cm.,Not 5 star legendary service. Not one 100% customer service award awarded here. 

I used to work at starbucks as a batista. I know the standards. The same standards I hold every customer service establishment. Which is just that. Customer service. 

The cleanliness was sub-par. Wasn't greeted at the door. Maybe because these  7.50/hr baristas simply didn't mind eating their tip. Maybe they just forgot because of the ""rush"". . . No. There was one person in line. Two including me. Anywhore. The lady was nice. Took my order, and said ""next"". . . Ok whatever. I sit down, the chair looked dingy. Or maybe because people in phoenix dont like light. It was so dark. The patrons seemed all gay, must have been recovering from their midnight debauchery. Not a happy person in site. Is my drink ready yet? Ahhhhhhh nope. What the heck? There's hardly anyone here, what is taking so long? So instead of waiting impatiently, I caught up on my readers digest. Then remembered I had to knit my neice a scarf, so knit knit, pearl. Knit knit pearl... Ohhhh! My drink is finished! Yay! The barista was hot. But slow. Just my kind of man!

The coffee was good. So I guess perfection takes time. I mean look at the 16th chapel. Rome wasnt built in a day. But a espresso machine doesn't take ten minutes to extract a shot.

Not 5star legendary service. 100% not satisfied.,Ppl at counter were very nice and cheerful. It was the Starbucks experience I would expect. Music selection being played would be what I least enjoyed...to jazzy for my taste.,they not only remember my name, my fave drinks, exactly the way i love 'em and also my lil tricks for it, like my 2 straws.... they r have been the best so far.... wish was not a big o' corporate business so it could feel more cosy,The ladies working at this particular Starbucks were pretty damn peppy working late at night (red eye) and mid-AM.  A line with about 15 people in it, grumpy about their flights or having to pay for outrageously priced food (I fly first class, so this doesn't necessarily pertain to me) or their screaming child, these Starbucks workers had a smile.

The drink could have been a little stronger, but I know now to ask for another shot next time.,I Love this Place!!! Alway running into friends when on my breaks or lunches here is nice. And My Lovely Baristas have My Grande Quad Shot Americano with Caramel Drizzle down packed!

People always ask me why I selected a Brand name when it came to my morning JOE. Well, just like the bars I frequent, I like regular(s)

Have an Amazing Day!,This is Starbucks. I love everything about it. It doesn't have the local mom and pop feel, but I knew that it wouldn't before I walked in the doors. Its not mom and pop. Its corporate. I never have to repeat my drink to the ""baristas""
""Four shots over whipped cream"" 
They just grab a cup and start brewin. At most local places, they always look at me with a puzzled look, ask me to repeat it, or suggest something completely different. 

Friendly staff. Quick WiFi. Awesome vibe. FAST,It's a Starbucks....

Each gate section has one on the secure side.  At some gates it is centered (like A) it is located at the split.  With the C gates it is only located in one section of the C gates.,Needed Wi-Fi ASAP and I remembered this Starbucks was in the area. It was busy busy and the baristas took forever to get me an already made iced tea. Everyone was less than friendly and the tables were a mess! This poor guy was having a meeting and he was picking up trash from the empty tables so that the table would be clean. 

I stayed for a little while and the W-Fi didn't let me down! 2 stars for that.,The coffee had just been brewed and the staff was especially helpful. 

I find that people working at airport Starbucks are either very amicable and pleasant or extremely bitter. At this particular location it was the former. The cashier helped me decide what drink to order and we had a chat about the microbreweries at my destination (Denver!). Personality is a plus. 

The barista poured me a sample cup of skim milk for my iced coffee--what a novel idea instead of handing over a jug!  

Music was good today as well. A good spot to people watch if you have time before a flight.,Meah, it's airport SB and service is what you'd expect in PHX. Slow, slow, slow.,A diary of Starbuck's.
With two minutes before boarding, I head to the counter and ordered a Frappucino with whole milk, whipped cream, and a shot of espresso (an extra .79) I also took an apple danish since US Airways want up to $7 for a snack.

It was made quick and both were tasty.   I don't remember feeling the espresso kicking in.,So I recently stopped by PHX on a connecting flight and was welcomed by the 110 degree AZ summer desert that immediately turned me into a prune. So what better way to rehydrate than to go to the nearest beverage selling kiosk?! Hellooo Starbucks.

First, I have to say that I have never been a Starbucks addict (i.e. not a gold card holder) and I don't drink coffee. I KNOW it's a coffee place, but they also serve surprisingly tasty tea, so try it out sometime! My favorite used to be the shaken passion fruit tazo iced tea (the lemonade version makes it slightly sweeter than I like, but still good). After my visit here, my current favorite (and possibly the drink that has gotten me hooked to Starbucks) is the shaken green tea lemonade with a packet of honey and 2 pumps of that good old syrup. SOOO GOOD. I can drink them all day. Though in retrospect, not a good idea if you're going on a long flight. Lesson learned.

Anyways, the Starbucks here isn't really different from any other, except for the fact that it's in an airport...which when compared to other airport Starbucks really isn't different at all, BUT this one has AMAZING staff who's friendly and willing to make whatever your heart desires despite the long line of people they have to make special drinks for. And I think that in itself makes it stand out among the rest of the Starbucks I've been to.,You know what the 'bucks are all about, get a Venti for the long flight you won't regret it!,Yeah, yeah it's Starbucks. Everyone knows it tastes like burning, yet we always go back for more. Typically I'd not even write a review for such a giant chain, but this location does have a unique vibe that sets it apart from the rest. The staff is psychotically cheerful, and ZIPPY ZOOMY FAST. They can work through a line of 10 people with speed and composure that could humble Speedy Gonzalez! Also, the vast patio is dreamy, and is always buzzing with eye candy. Score. The big downfall, however is the iced coffee. Weak. Like.. 85 year old woman who reuses her Sanka grounds kinda weak.. I've had this problem at other locations, but certainly not at all. Buh. Ambience, and experience, however, are how this transformed from a 2 star review to a 3 star review...,I am waiting in this Starbucks for my friend to finish a conference call so we can go have some shopping time and relax later by the pool. Yes, I am on vacation and I have my work laptop and I really may never be really really on vacation because there is always something to finish, just one more thing, and if I go and do it I won't have to do it later. Enough about me. 

This Starbucks is near the downtown and near the metro rail line. There are about 30 seats inside and 30 outside, which now is great because it si about 70 degrees outside. I imagine from May to November the outside seats are insufferably hot. I got adequate service here, the coffee is the coffee. 

I can feel shane m.'s pain because I was a Starbucks supervisor back in the day too. This place passes at this moment, but you can catch the wrong partner at the wrong time and Boom! One star. 

I will come back here if I am ever nearby when I need a SBUX fix.,had to go... I don't drink stuff here unless I must,Holy smokes the service is REALLY SLOW!!! If I hadn't already paid I would have left. Almost missed my plane.,This is for the Terminal 4 location, at the beginning of the 'D' concourse just past security.  This location, unlike so many outside of the airport, really has its act together.  They're fast, efficient, polite, and you shouldn't worry if the line is long because it will move fast.  I've never been impressed with Starbucks as far as efficiency & accuracy but this place shattered expectations.  Beverage quality was pretty much the same as any other location.,This is my favorite starbucks. The employees here are friendly and they are pretty quick considering it is *never* not busy. I went today and sat on the patio and had a yogurt parfait and a cup of coffee. It was very enjoyable.,This Starbucks opens at 5:30 a.m., so if you're in there for a 6am flight it is such a tease to see them behind the counter setting up for the day and you cannot order! 

In the mornings there are about 10 people working so it goes pretty fast. That said, the line is ridiculously long since it's the first thing people see on the other side of security and since you cannot bring your coffee through with you, they are all salivating to get frisked so they can run and get in line.,I don't feel like contributing too much to the Starbucks is too corporate discussion, since I'm a little too tired to beat a dead horse. Instead, I will say that this Starbucks location is, as expected, pretty similar to all other Starbucks I've frequented, except for one thing:

The service is ridiculously slow. There were only 4 people in front of us in line, and we waited 10 minutes just to place our order. I feel like the airport is the one place where service should be expedited. 

Other than that rant (and the fact that the prices are inflated due to the airport location), this location has a few positive things going for it: plenty of seating, a pre-security location, and well-made drinks. Three stars.,Same old stuff, real busy - has been less busy with the opening of the C Gate Starbucks.,this is the best starbucks i've visited in phoenix:

 my drink is ready quickly, even when it is crazy busy. every employee seems to be kind, efficient and intelligent. when a snafu occurs, they quickly recover with sincerity. i've sat inside only once, and it was too intense for me on a weekday morning. outside feels peaceful. the level of intensity i measure is based directly on where i am sitting so the offering of a tree to sit under and grass to sit on makes me a lucky girl! this is a friendly starbucks. i like it.,I've flown out quite a few times from Sky Harbor and always stop by Terminal 4's Starbucks before lift off! They never cease to be fast and friendly. My fave drink of the moment is a Grande Iced Chai Tea Latte with soy milk. For airport service, this place is top notch!,Drinks are consistent (as are most chains)
Good atmosphere to work, lots of tables with plenty of outlets for laptops if needed
great outdoor area to relax & drink coffee
Baristas are friendly,Quick and efficient service both our BSTL (black shaken tea lemonade) and drip coffee was provided immediately after ordering.... no complaints.,AMAZING!  This is the first time I ever got what I ordered!!!!!  140 degree grande peppermint latte!  WOWZA!  YIPPEE!  Though the staff did not seemed thrilled to be there or had any sort of personality-it didn't matter because my drink was perfect:)  FYI-this was the location outside of the B security check-point.,quite possible the only starbucks in arizona that could be referred to as the gay starbucks and people would know what your talking about, (kinda like gay denny's), i wouldn't even relate that fame to the constant cast of characters outside ""people watching"" but for awhile, 90% of the employees were gay.

this starbucks is a great place to sit outside and chill and chat up the regulars. i miss alot of the former employees of this starbucks, they were all really cool people. some of them just randomly disappeared, whatever happened to that skinny guy who kinda looked like the devil, and that Blondie? what would you need to do to get fired?? being too cool for everyone? oh well. 

i have been comped so many drinks here its no wonder the last two managers were fired. lol. but that's part of the things that made me love this bux. cool employees who knew how to make you come back. (maybe I'll get a free drink today....no? well maybe next time)

chain coffee shops are considered the antichrist to a lot of coffee shop superheros but lets face it. the coffee isn't so great..neither is the food, but it's the status symbol to have that green straw in your cup.,Conveniently located after security at Gate B9 this starbucks at the Phoenix airport is conveniently located. It is not crowded and they have enough barristas to handle the coming passenger.

They serve all the starbucks drinks and have a limited selection of food items. No seating, just take-out.

The staff is friendly and effective.,You may think this is a cop out... writing a review of Starbucks. It's like writing a review of water. (""It's wet, delicious and necessary to my survival!"") 

My aim is simple here though. This particular Starbucks location is an excellent place for people watching. Try hanging out there between the hours of 11am and 1pm on a Friday afternoon and tell me you aren't entertained by some of the patrons who go in and out of the doors. While attending school, I was taking a screenwriting class and given the arduous task of writing descriptions of about 35 random people. Where did I go to write every single one of them? Park Central Starbucks. 

The crew here is also super friendly every time I come in and they do their best to remember my name. It doesn't help that I tell them a different name every time. OK that's not true, but what a fun social experiment that would make.

The coffee... been there, done that and there's not much else I can say about it, but for the sport of people-watching, this a great place to hang out in the corner and just take it all in.,Triple Berry muffin was great. Fast service in the airport.,They really need to add some staff. Each time I stop at this one it seems to take an usually long time. Add the fact that when I get an iced coffee here, hair doesn't start growing on my chest as it does when I order it at other locations. Boo.,So when I started yelping I pretty much told myself I would never write a review for a chain because let's be honest - they all seem to be the same. The only exceptions would be a terrible experience or a really great experience. Luckily this Starbucks is a latter.

This Starbucks is in a great location, has a phenomenal outdoor seating area (some under a roof, other parts out in the open), and the staff is SPECTACULAR! Unlike many of the other starbucks in the area where I find myself waiting a whole lot - this starbucks gets you through the line quick drink in hand! They've always been super friendly and interact with you more than just ""what can I get started for you today."" Such a great experience every time I've been there!

I am by no means a regular at the moment since I don't get into the area very often but the fact that some of the employees are already starting to remember my drink is pretty darn impressive!!

Random comment: As a Starbucks Gold card holder (with name printed on the card) isn't it weird that they ask for my name as they're holding the card in their hand? Seems kind of repetitive to me personally. (Doesn't effect my review just wanted to throw it out there into the universe),After only a week here, this is the best Starbucks I've been to yet. The employees are very nice, and they KNOW how to make a Salted Caramel Mocha. This location is on Central between Catalina and Osborn. It's convenient to the light rail. There is some inside seating, though more is available outside.  On the days when I go into the office, I've learned to stop here for my SCM instead of hitting the Starbucks downtown near the office.,I made a break for it from the gate and hit this Starbucks up to try and wake up.


""The Good""
- The staff were very nice and the drinks were flying off the counter. They also knew how to handle the line that formed out of no where.
- There were a decent amount of tables and chairs.

""The Meh""
- The decent amount of tables were taken up by one wanna-be hipster each that did not always even have a damn Starbucks drink.... I think they need a bouncer.


""The Bad""
- Nothing really bad ... its a Starbucks. They will most likely be busy with the same people you sharded a plane with. So, if you want to be the crowd, use the restroom, sit and talk with someone... then go grab a drink.,This Starbucks has been remodeled and now looks like a hospital cafeteria. Gone are the plush velvety sofas and over-sized chairs which I loved to sit on while flipping through a good mag or chatting it up with a pal. No more warm and fuzzy feeling Starbucks. I hate this new look and will not be back EVER! BTW - The place was empty at 10am on a Saturday. Hmmm?,Starbucks is Starbucks wherever you go, so this review is based on the location/atmosphere.  I love all the outdoor seating here - there are tons of tables, comfy chairs, umbrellas, plants, etc.  Every time I have been to this location there are always tons of people filling these areas.  It's a good place to meet up with a friend and spend some time.  (Provided we're still in the cool season).  Enjoy!,THIS STARBUCK'S IS AWESOME! Amazing Cstr Service! ALWAYS Super friendly, always smiling with a positive attitude! HIGHLY recommend this location in particular, as well as this location being known as the Gay Starbuck's.  :),This is where all the hipsters and downtown people go after work.  It's pretty packed, but a nice place.  Staff is very cool and you get your drinks out in a reasonable time.  I love the outside seating. There is plenty of it.,just about the only place to get coffee on Mill.,Probably the worst bagel I've ever eaten... granted, I should know better for ordering a bagel at an airport Starbucks, however I was starving, I was super late to my gate, and it was right in front of it.  I'll wait for peanuts next time.,Great help!,I like this starbucks for a few key reasons; the location is very close to my house, the service is always very fast, and the staff is ALWAYS so nice!  Im also addicted to those little artisan sandwiches they make.,Walk-up is faster and more efficient than drive-thru. I sat for 8 - yes, EIGHT minutes today with two cars ahead of me at 3:00 pm - hardly peak hours. When I got to the window it was another THREE minutes before I was acknowledged... drove away with the wrong drink. BAH.,These guys are awesome - relentlessly polite, friendly, upbeat. My pup and I drive through each morning, and they know my drink order, and my dog's name, by heart.

This is a really busy location at certain times of day, so the car line can sometimes be long, but I always see them working as fast as they can, and they've given me a free coffee on several occasions when the wait was too long.

NOTE: There's a new Starbucks policy that you have to steam milk individually for each drink now (where relevant), you can't steam a pot in advance and pour it as needed. This makes for a fresher drink, but slows down the line. Not the fault of they guys on the front line...

Awesome Starbucks team here - love 'em.,The only reason I go to this location is because it's the closest/fastest drive thru by my house.

But the staff is rude. In the past 5 yrs Ive seen them go thru several baristas and it seems like their attitudes just keep getting worse and worse.

Ive had one or two tell me that the fact that i put soy in my mochas is ""totally gross"", ive had my food given to other walk up customers and been argued w? when i pointed it out, and just this morning my barista at the drive thru gave me my coffee, and card and then slammed the window shut and walked away w/ out giving me my receipt. I waved and finally the other girl saw me and made a face like ""Ugh, what now. "" (um, hi kids. Us customers, can see you thru your windows.) when the girl came back she said ""What."" I politely asked her for my receipt, she gave it to me and reslammed the window.

We get it, you think youre *awesome* just because youre a Starbucks barista.....well youre not.

For speed, this location gets 4 stars, customer service, 2.,Your typical Statbucks experience just a lil pricier cause it' the airport (:,hmmm.....some interesting reviews for this location..... well, I have to put my two cents in because I actually would like to give this location some props! For some reason, today everyone decided to get coffee at *exactly* the same time, 11a.m. (weird time for a coffee break, in my opinion...then again, I was there too, wasn't I? humf....) The drive thru lane was looonnngggg.....even the walk up window looked crowded, tho to my surpirse, I didn't have to wait more then 5 minutes to actually order AND receive my drink! All this AND the guy at the window  (who was quite friendly, btw) told me that today they had a 21 personnel meeting at that location and they were also right in the middle of changing shifts. Bad timing for a coffee rush, but very well handled!!

On a side note, I've never had any problems with the drinks or food at this location. If anything, one time they gave us one too many oatmeals, which we were not charged for and got to keep. I will take that kind of mistake anytime! (even if I have no idea what to do with an extra oatmeal.....)

and yeah, it's in an oddly positioned spot in a small parking lot, but, hey, it just gives us all an opportunity to show off our manners and kindness to each other, right?? (well, AFTER we get our coffee.......),I really like this location. Now, I generally stop by in the morning around 7:45 or so, so this review is probably more for the a.m., not so much how it is in the p.m.

Service is always fast and the employees are very friendly. Yesterday I ordered a coffee and a breakfast wrap. The coffee came fast, but apparently they had forgotten to warm my wrap. They gave me a voucher for a free drink for having forgotten (it's not like I waited that long, I just had to ask about it, I didn't even complain or anything)

Anyways, very happy with this location for my morning fix.

(oh yeah, parking is a problem though. But, usually that early in the morning, you can find parking on the street. The parking meters are free before 8 a.m.),This is a good Starbucks if you don't want to have to walk in! You can either walk up or drive through, i'd rather just drive up and go.,This is a quiet Starbuck's in an airport! Wow....didn't think this could exist? Well now that I blab about it on Yelp!, it may become slightly busier. It's situated in an odd location at the end of a usually broken moving sidewalk connecting the C and D concourses within Terminal 4. (Southwest). 

I really like a Starbuck's with no line and will be back!,Yup, I'm gonna review a Starbucks in an airport.... 

I think I always grab a coffee here, with each flight. The staff is friendly. 

As MarNae B said, it's a ""lil pricier"". A tall cup of drip coffee is $2.07 with tax. 

You can use your Starbucks cards here, but you can't reload.,My morning ritual Monday through Friday is a trip to my local Starbucks.  The employees there are very friendly, knowledgeable and always treat me like family.  They make it a point to know your name and your drink preferences.  We often have our drinks waiting for us when we arrive because they've seen us across the street....now that's service.  What an awesome group of individuals, Starbucks should be proud.,Not sure what all the fuss is with the negative reviews but I have always left with an excellent drink made right.

The drive thru for me has always been super quick but my tip would be to go here around 5:30 in the afternoon. There never seems to be a line or peop",0.203349661
Solo Café Gourmet Coffee & Tea House,"Love the local coffee houses! Gotta support them. I've been coming in for girls nite & every time have had a great experience. The iced chai is soooo good. I'm hooked. Great music & comfy sofa to relax & chat for hours w the girls. I'll be back for sure.,Exceptional service, unique selection of teas and high quality coffee. Can't beat the free WiFi and melodic background music. The atmosphere completes the overall experience of the perfect space to enjoy a refreshing beverage, a good read, and conversation. There's even an assortment of books and board games for customers. Also very cool art that provides an urban feel. Any interest would appreciate a Solo experience :),I have passed this cute little joint a couple times and I felt like today was a great day to make the plunge!  I was not disappointed in the least.  I got a coffee and a muffin both of which were delicious.   The place was quaint and laid back and made me feel right at home.  For a person who does not like sitting in a coffee shop or restaurant alone that is quite the accomplishment!  Needless to say, I will be a returning customer...I recommend to all coffee drinks that have not been...to go! (=,Out of all the places I frequented during my time in Tempe as a college student, I miss this place the most.

When I discovered this place near the beginning of my senior year, I went perhaps 3-4 times a month. The ambiance and friendly service from the baristas is enough to pick this place over Starbucks or some other chain, but no, this place goes the extra mile in every which way.

The coffee is brewed to order, with top shelf organic, fair trade ingredients. This means you're going to have to wait a bit for your drink (about 5 minutes, unless its busy, then maybe perhaps as much as 10 if only one guy is working the bar). So this place isn't if you want a quick cup of joe to go. But the coffee is well worth the wait. 

Coming from the DC area, I've been to my fair share of coffee houses, and this is by far and away the best coffee I've ever had. The baristas are experts at presenting the full flavor of whatever drink you order. Everything on the menu is worth a shot, and be sure to ask the barista on duty for their picks if you're feeling indecisive.

This is the perfect place to come after class and order a large (or two) and work on school work. The clientele is mostly college folk and other assorted hipster types, so if you're into the local art or music scenes, you can come down here and make a few friends.

Cannot recommend this place enough.,great coffee and customer service!!! 
Such a good deal compare to the quantity and quality plus they have stamp card.

Love the atmosphere, has lots of arts on the wall and book on the shelf.

One thing I want to request is....sometimes, they have noisy music that makes me tired. If they have relaxing music, I would put 5 stars!,I had a morning meeting at Solo this morning. The atmosphere was great, very casual and eclectic. The coffee was also very good and they serve it up in GIANT glasses. I can put down my fair share of coffee, almost always require a refill, but this time I think it outlasted me!

I definitely recommend to anybody in the neighborhood to pay a visit to Solo.,This place is chill. We like to come here to chill.
Service is great- they always have suggestions for patrons.
The atmosphere is cozy and eclectic. The artwork ranges from interesting to what-the-hell-is-that?
There are some nights where there is live music- I wouldn't suggest comig here to chit-chat on those nights. Come for the music.,The atmosphere and artwork - amazing. Baristas - great, but they like to get to know you after a few visits and then they become friendlier. Spicy Chai Latte Hot - a little bit of heaven.

Ill be honest, I discovered ""my drink"" on my first visit (I stop by at least once a week since it's near work) Hot Spicy Chai Latte with Skim milk. The ""spicy"" gives the drink an extra kick that you just don't get with a normal chai latte. So I never have every ordered anything else. 

My huge pet peeve? They don't always open at 8am like they state on their door. Not just by a few minutes, but sometimes not even within the first hour... I want to support this great local hangout and it's hard to if they don't open their doors. NOTE - 8am! Yes, they sell coffee, but I guess they need to sleep in first. :rollseyes:

Also it's a great place to meet a client in a late morning etc. There are some seats outside for when it's a beautiful AZ day.,Only been here once, but I can definitely see myself getting into the ultra-chill, relaxed vibe of this cafe. 

There was a large and unique variety of teas that I wanted to try out, but I chickened out and just got a chai tea latte, which was quite yummy.

The wait was pretty long while I was here, but since it was my vacation and I didn't really have anything else to do (and the ""view"" was not so bad... heh heh) I didn't really mind. It's probably a little too noisy to function as a study place for me, since I need absolute quiet, but I can see it being a great hang-out spot with friends.,Solo Cafe is definitely one of the premier coffeehouses in the Phoenix area. They make excellent coffee drinks from Ron Cortez-roasted beans and all of their tea and pastries are from local businesses as well.

The ambiance at Solo can best be described as upscale eclectic. It definitely isn't pretentious, but it isn't the typical bohemian coffeehouse feel. The owners of Solo just completed a minor facelift of the shop, changing out some of the art and rearranging the interior. On the back wall, they added a large mural which features the Solo Cafe name. Also, they're in the process of adding a kitchen so that they can offer a wider selection of food, which I think will serve to make this awesome coffeehouse even better.

Solo Cafe is a gem among the Phoenix coffee scene and it's great to see a local business thriving.,Great place, but is closed now as of Feb 17. Note on door about closure due to non-payment of license fees. Also a note that updates will be on Facebook, but nothing there. 

Too bad.,I was really impressed by the service here, quick, friendly and awesome.  

I did a quick scan of the wall of teas to choose from and settled on Yerba Mate as soon as I saw it because it reminded me of Logie and her crazy tea thread.  The tea was brewed to perfection and in three minutes I was drinking delicious iced tea.  

This is a really laid back place and I always see people on their laptops here so I'm assuming they have free wifi too.  Cool decor - my new favorite coffee house.,This place is RAD:

1. Coffee is good.
2. Ambiance is classy and chill.
3. Place has character.
4. Free wireless.,Love it! Best - and possibly only - coffee shop to get a spicy chai latte in the east valley. The barista, who is almost always the same guy whenever I stop in there, is very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about what he does.,First time there. The guy working there was very nice, he recommend a ice coffee with room for cream. Loved it. Nice place to kill time.,I love Solo! I don't get there frequently enough but it is one of my favorite places to hang out with friends or catch up on emails (free wifi). The art and books are fun, especially if you can snag a seat at the couch or lounge chairs. The people who work there are super friendly and they will remember you after you've been there a few times (always a great feeling). I have to confess, in general I love coffee shops for the atmosphere and not for the drinks, but Solo has great tea options and I am always pleased.,Many, many stars for the mild and delicately flavored (i.e., not burnt to hell, sbux style) coffee! Very refreshing to not have to temper the glass of acid indigestion with fifteen Splenda packets. The dude working there was really nice, although in no hurry. I was hoping for a bigger selection of food, but it looked like biscotti from Costco was it for me. Maybe I was too late (9 am)? No worries -- I'll be back, when I'm in this part of town. A very pleasant surprise!,I've been coming to Solo on and off for the last 4 years. It's a great place to sit and work, hang out and chat or just pick up a quick drink. The coffee and tea are high quality and there's an assortment of locally made pastries available to snack on.

What I really like about this place is the consistent quality of product and service. The owner is an awesome guy that works the floor and sincerely cares about his business and his customers.,It took me a year to venture from my Apartments from across the street to Solo Cafe, but I'm glad I did tonight. The place is a little small, cozy is a good descriptive word for it. The staff is very friendly and enjoy what they do. They offer ""to go"" or ""hangin' around"" options (meaning disposable if you intend to dash, or glass if you intend to stay).

The menu has a wide variety and fair price for each item. I always go for Italian Sodas (I'm not a huge coffee drinker myself). The night I went there was a local jam band playing in the corner and they really set the mood of the place. It is definitely worth stopping by.,There's lots of good things to say about this cafe.

1) Small but lots of seating. Cozy.
2) Wonderful espresso
3) Nice baristas
4) Very convenient location
5) Prices are competitive

Reminds me of cafes that I used to visit a lot when I lived in a smaller city.  I defintely recommend!,Great staff, clean, swanky and nice local artists displayed on the walls.,Iced coffee on a nice day out on the patio, or iced tea on a hot day in the cool AC.  So much better than going to a chain! Thanks Chad!

This place is always so welcoming when you walk in the door.  There are cool clusters of furniture and tables, a record player, and tons of books and games to peruse.  

The cafe is connected to Alter Ego Salon, so it's the perfect way to spend an afternoon getting pampered and sipping yummy coffee drinks.  And you can also go splurge on Mexican food next door!,I love Solo, have been coming here when the owner Chad, was the only employee. We would talk LOST theories and what not. Really chill place to grab amazing coffee. They have more baristas now, and I've had some of them not be consistent on the quality, but lately it seems that they have gotten it down.

The best part is that they sell Cortez coffee, which is fair-trade. Our favorite roast is the primo, which is the same roast they use for their espresso. It is fresh and delicious.

I definitely recommend coming here for coffee, as other reviewers have said, it's not the fastest place, so if you are in a hurry, you may have to come when you don't have to run out the door. But if you aren't in a rush, enjoy!,coffee is great! very friendly staf and great place to relax and drink a cup of coffee :-),Barista Bradley makes a mystery tea. He uses cookies to make it! Or maybe not. I don't know. But it tastes like gingerbread men. He is pretty cool. He poses like zoolander and says things like 'Right ON!"",Berkeley, California feel.,Looking for a new place to try not too far from home but far enough. Ended up at Solo after reading a friend's review on arizonacoffee.com. The barista was way friendly and laid back. Got a ginger peach tea that was oversteeped, but the ham & cheese croissant was awesome. Tried a mocha next, and thought it was kinda cool that it didn't come in the traditional sort of coffee cup. Really enjoyed it. I hate drinks that are too hot and this was just right. Been here 90 minutes today and feel like I just slipped into a place like a comfortable glove. Great place to work, grade, and chill. Free WIFI, Too!,Awesome ambiance! Great seats, etc. plus great coffee - and the foam on the coffee is to die for.

Note: I went in last Friday and the barista was SUPER RUDE.  I specifically asked for my MEDIUM coffee in a MUG not a glass cup- who wants to drink hot coffee out of a glass cup...Not me.  I was on the phone when ordering, which must have pissed him off.  When I picked up my coffee, I said I had wanted it in a mug. He said ""mediums only come in the tall cups- you ordered a medium.""  I reminded him that I asked for it in a mug- even if it was a medium.  He acted put off and then dumped it briskly into a large mug and said there you go.... Which of course ruined the foam.   My husband likes this place, but  I don't.  There are plenty of great coffee shops in PHX that don't treat you this way.  NOT a fan of this place.,I love coming to my neighborhood coffee shop. Open mic nights, rotating drinks, burritos, good music,  helpful staff, cool artwork, and a library make this place the amazing place that it is. The staff is really helpful and quick as well. Big ups to them!,So I've been at Solo Cafe for about 2 and a half hours now writing a paper and so far so good! 

When I first arrived here I was greeted by a very friendly barista who was happy to discuss the drink options with a first-timer. I settled on a mocha and it was delicious! I like that it wasn't scorching hot - so I could enjoy it right away instead of having to sit and stare at it for 5 minutes. 

Also I really like the atmosphere here. The place is pretty small (I like this in a coffee shop - at least until I get here and there's no where to sit). It's also pretty quiet, which makes it a good place to sit and study. My favorite part is that I have been here for a while now and don't feel obligated to leave like some places. 

The -1 star is because the chair I'm sitting isn't very comfortable (hahah) but they do have couches, which is probably a better alternative. Also, they don't have a very wide selection of pastries/food. This is always a bummer when I go to a place to study. I'm generally pretty lazy, so I don't like having to stop working to go somewhere else to get food. Despite this I will definitely be returning soon!

(Anyway, my Yelp break is over... back to the paper) :(,Oh man, as good as it gets! I love their coffee and espresso. Art is hanging on the walls, lots of books, conversation. You're not treated like a number, rushed out the door as fast as possible. I used to go to a coffee shop like this in Moscow, Russia. I love this place. If I lived a little closer to it, I would go daily.,In a city full of chain coffee shops it's nice to find this gem tucked away inside a dull strip mall. 

It's a small place but laid out in such a way that allows for a good numbers of tables and a couch area. The atmosphere is laid-back and comfortable and the people working behind the counter are friendly.

I can't speak to the coffee section but they have a decent loose-leaf tea selection and they will make it iced or hot.

The only thing I found lacking was a selection of snacks. Sometimes it's nice to grab a muffin or a cookie when you're hanging out.

If you're looking for a good alternative to Starbucks or just want a place to hang out and read or study, Solo Cafe is an excellent option.,was a regular for a while. Over time found the friendliness from the staff to be a bit of an act. Zombie hipsters. Long wait.,Solo is definitely one of my favorite places to get espresso now.  After checking out the great reviews on here, I decided to skip on my usuals (XB, Steve's)  and come here.  (No negatives or neutrals this time!)

+ Great location.  Strip mall, not too much traffic.  The storefront faces Baseline, so you can sit in comfort and watch cars go by.

+ The atmosphere is amazing!  I walked in and automatically felt at home.  There are couches, benches, tables, outside seating.  Everything you want in a coffee shop.  There's beautiful photography on the walls (which you can buy), including one of Jared Leto (or at least it looks just like him).  And there are plenty of places to plug in your laptop.

+ Local coffee!! I love it when local shops use homegrown stuff.  I had never had this kind of espresso, but all I can say is that it's damn good.  I can't remember the name, though.

+ The drinks.  Oh. My. Word.  I ordered a cafe mocha with no whip.  It was smooth, creamy, and had just the right amount of mocha.  It was to die for.  Also, if you're a big foam fan, you'll love any of their hot drinks.  I had about an inch of foam in my cup and it was thick and flavorful.

+ The service is just as great as the coffee.  The guy at the counter was polite, helped me choose a good drink, and smiled.  

I must say, it's going to be very difficult for me to find a place better than here.,I really wanted to like this place, as I always do with local coffee shops that are trying to compete with the Starbucks monster. Plus, it's right next to the hair salon I frequent (Altered Ego - it's great). However, there were several factors that made me bring down a five-star review (for the coffee) to a three. 

First, I do want to emphasize that the drink I got was absolutely divine. I ordered a caffe latte with almond milk and sugar-free vanilla syrup, and it came out really well.

The problem, however, was that I was getting the drink to go and it took at least 10 minutes for them to make it. I'm seriously not sure what the barista was doing (two people were behind the counter chatting). I was kind of in a hurry and was expecting it not to take very long to steam some milk, press the coffee, and put some syrup in. I tried to banter a little with the barista and she was having none of it. (Apparently she was tired and caffeine wasn't doing it.) Please, if the CUSTOMER is making the effort to put YOU in a good mood, try to let it happen

The other thing was that while the cafe was totally full, everybody was totally silent. As H.C. said, the place was full of zombie hipsters. It was really creepy. As I walked by various tables, people stared at me like I was interrupting their very important business. 

In conclusion, if you want to work on your computer in total silence and thus don't mind a) the long wait or b) the fact that everyone else is also totally silent, you will fit right in. I definitely loved my drink, but I don't know if I will be able to withstand the death stares for long enough to order.,Delicious mochas! Great baristas who are all happy to serve. I ordered a small double and was given a medium triple because of a (happy) mistake, and was glad to know that it was appropriately strong. The atmosphere is fantastic, a record player with headphones, a chess table, some great decor and a plethora of books to keep one entertained. Great place to sit and do homework or chat with a friend.,If you're looking for a local coffee shop in southern Tempe, Solo Coffee is your place. Locally owned and roasting great coffee from Cortez, this is a staple.

Solo isn't large and spacious, but more quant and eclectic. Local art covers the walls, an LP is playing on the record player, and someone is surely cozied up on the red velvet couch that sits in the center of the coffee shop.

If you get bored with your work, fear not! You can play Battleship, Chess, or Jenga to pass the time. And above all else, the coffee is superb. So get to Solo and enjoy warming up when it's cold outside.,Judging by the reviews below, I'm guessing my negative experience was isolated. I stopped in for a single cup of regular brew coffee.. The credit card machine was acting up, and I see that I was charged 3 times on my bank statement. Those things happen, I realize, but what really sours the situation is the coffee itself - I've honestly had better from Folger's... once again, I realize that most places in the area seem to concentrate on making tasty lattes, and mochas, but I'm not a fluffy drink kind of guy. Their dark roast is forgettable, at best, and very weak. boo.,I had been in Tempe for 3 days when I found this place on Loqly. Great coffee, and coolest barista ever gave me all the info on the local music and art scene (thanks Ty!). Great ambience, relaxing, nice art on the walls. A great place to hang out. Food is limited to croissants and pastries but hey, you're here for the coffee, tea, and great people! If you do get hungry My Big Fat Greek Restaurant (great!) and a Taste of the Caribbean are in the same strip mall.,As a recent grad who just quit her job, I find that I have a lot of time on my hands.... I am needing to fill my days while escaping the confines of my house.... so I've been on the hunt for local coffee houses to clear my head at.... Solo Cafe may be my favorite.

Solo Cafe is really fantastic.  The staff is super friendly and know their coffee. Everything I've ordered has been made perfectly, not to mention they DON'T CHARGE EXTRA FOR SOY, which probably pushes them into first place on my list.  I love the nutty taste soy adds to my coffee but refuse to pay extra for it at other coffee houses.  

The atmosphere is perfect.  Its quiet enough to get work done, unlike a busy bustling Starbucks.  There is free Wifi and ample tables to work at.  They are even equipped with extra electrical outlets (which can be a huge detriment in other coffee houses)!!!!  Go Solo Cafe!!!  There are huge bookshelves (not filled with the usual trashy romance novels), cool local art, giant robots (yes, robots), comfy cushy couches and chairs if you are more in the mood to curl up with a book rather than ferociously write a paper.,The time has finally come to review Solo Cafe.  I've been here quite a few times, and every time that I return I get a more and more positive feeling about it.  I plan to update this review after another number of months and see if I can get it to five stars, but here's what got it to four so far:

* Lots of people studying - a great place to go if you're like me and prefer the communal suffering of a busy studying environment.
* As many people have mentioned - the wifi
* Grunge music - kind of random for a coffee shop but suits this one well
* Friendly, but not overly bubbly, barristas who know a ton not only about their own coffee, but the local importers and competitors
* Reasonable prices
* and last but not least - the cool murals on the wall

Solo Cafe is definitely the best coffee shop in that Southern Tempe area.  If you work in the Autoplex or AZ Mills - stop by here for sure!,This is one of the best coffee shops I have ever been to.  Very relaxing yet stimulating with lots to look at.  Never too busy. Great place to hang out and work or study.  Free wifi, great food options and the best coffee and tea. Reasonably priced as well.  The guy that owns it is really chill and cool. My wife and I hit coffee shops all the time to study and work and this is one of the best places we have found. We drive 25 miles just because this place is the best.  They are adding some sandwiches and a roaster later in '09.,I walked by this little cafe twice when limping around High Noon heat in the mall that Tempe forgot. Mr. Mustachio lives around the corner from this weird little outdoor mall/office building complex that is meant to be a homey homage to main street.  But the reality feels more like the off season at a Disney attraction, complete with roadies with cans of tall bud lights and camels and bored office dudes cyborging it up with bluetooths. 

US Eggs, yummy burritos, pizza places, temp agencies (guess why I am here chugging coffee in the middle of a workday), booze and various other offices call this place home. I actually thought the store front was part of Altered Egos salon. When I entered, I was almost delirious with a 20 minute walk without shade with copious amounts of breast sweat. I had to get coffee and cool off before heading to the temps. 

This place was a really nice surprise- the others described the place really well, but classy is how I would put it-but kind of gay goth classy? Plus leather chairs, pews, short round tables, red velvet couches with dark wooden floors, big plants, tiffany style lamps, classic bike hanging over the bar, bookshelves crammed with books suspiciously resembling those from the free cart at Changing Hands, and a cute little Wii, this place is nice for the desert man. 

My barista was cool, and he made me a decaf iced americano that was pretty damn tasty and didn't charge for soy milk (it was on the counter) and gave me iced tap water free of charge. I wanted to eat, but truthfully the offerings were bare. I love larabars, but I can't pay twice as what is charged in supermarkets and the pastries were pretty bland and unappealing and saw no other food to buy-and I was trying!

I had to look to plug in my laptop-plenty at the pews, but I went to Catholic school and don't wish to put more time into having a numb ass (take that as you will) and ended up near the door.

Get some more food, unplug some lamps, more cushiness and I will seriously come here a lot!,Solo Cafe is like The Usual Suspects.  Great, memorable scenes, sharp dialogue flying about, and a remarkable cast.  And a soundtrack that fits naturally with its environment.

Slinging the lattes and mochas are a few gents not new to making an awesome cup (or glass) of java and if they are, you'd never know because the drinks are not only delicious every time, but consistent from whoever makes them.  

Whether or not you stumble upon Solo for the 1st time or go in there knowing it well, you will enjoy the laid back atmosphere, the great service, and delicious beverages.  Not to mention unlike other cafes, this one is open late (for coffee hours that is...) 

So go in, get an iced cafe mocha with soy milk (my personal fave) and skip the Bucks that's overpriced and impersonal.  Support the ""little guy"".  You'll feel sooo much better slurping on the caffeine that way.,After finding Fitness Road a couple weeks ago, I knew I wanted to swing by this coffee shop the next time I was in the area.  It was surprisingly busy, with most tables inside taken.  I ordered a latte, and since there was only one person working I had to wait about 10 minutes.  No biggie, I wasn't in a hurry.  

The latte was delicious!  The environment was quiet......too quiet.  Service was pleasant.  I think I'm not enough of a ""hipster"" to fit in here.  Can't say I'd be back, but my experience was A-OK!,This place is always crowded as many work or just waste bytes using fb here. You might have trouble finding a space to sit, enjoy their coffee or tea and talk. 

Decoration makes it very comfortable and the barista that day was a star! My friend had the hot chocolate and I tried one of their fancy teas. 

My wish, that they could use ceramic cups if it is not a take out.,Non corporate coffee

Solo cafe has become my new favorite place to have my cup of joe and work.
 
Ty makes a rockin americano or cappucino and they have a great variety of teas and some awesome pastries. 

The vibe in the place is very cool with awesome artwork and cool tunes in the background - no muzak.

It is also not too loud and has free and easy wifi and outlets everywhere. Might just trade in my gold starbucks card.,Love love love this place... Winner in Best of Phoenix mag a few times. The coffee is good however I love their loose leaf teas. Hot or iced... Mixed and matched for unique favors... Records play over heard and you can bring in your own records to be played or choose from the lot they have ... Cool people, younger college crowd, very comfy feeling.  I've been coming here on and off for a few years now,Great atmosphere and great coffee! 
Barista was very friendly.
Great attitudes and products make me want to come back for sure!,LOVE this place! 

I went here to meet friends and grab a coffee last weekend and it was perfect! Great service, delicious Latte, clean and cute design with seating inside, and just the perfect mix of people to make it feel like a great place to converse or enjoy a coffee and relax on your own. 

BONUS: There's a really cute hair salon connected through a side door - I'm coming back for a coffee and a hair cut next time!,This place is so cute! I walked in and was promptly greeted by a very friendly barista-man. Since I'd never been before, I asked him if there was anything on the menu he was especially proud of and he recommended I try the white chocolate mocha. I found a cute little table in the corner and they brought it out to me. He was right, it's delicious! It reminds me of the mochas I get in Seattle. 

The whole place is great. Interesting art on the walls, old school library feel and tasty coffee. The only thing I would change is I would expand their pastry selection a little. 

Summary: Friendly, cheerful, cozy, cool art, nice music, fast wifi, and splendid coffee!,Solo is my favorite coffeehouse in Tempe, though I'll start out by admitting I seldom drink coffee. They have a great selection of loose leaf teas and will brew it for you plain or as a latte. I recommend the Toasty Almond as a latte or a Yerba Matte Latte.  Spicy Pear brewed plain with just a touch of honey is amazing, too.  When it comes to a coffee house, atmosphere is just as important as drinks, and Solo is a really nice place to spend time.  Free wi-fi, tons of outlets, a variety of seating, friendly baristas, good decor, diverse music, clean restroom, all that good stuff.  If you have been meaning to stop in, do, and you'll become a regular before you know it.,Five Stars. Why? Because it's damn near impossible to get a decent espresso pull in Tempe, and this place does it. Plus, it's close to my house (in Phoenix terms, at least) and to me, that counts for a lot.

Did I mention that the owners are really, really, really, really nice? Really. Nice. And they care about their coffee in a way I haven't seen since I left Oregon (shout out to Stumptown in PDX and Full City in the Euge).

The coffee is freshly roasted -- from Cafe Cortez here in town -- and the atmosphere makes you forget you're in a strip mall (not a bad strip mall, but still).

Please, please, please go here. Give them your money. They deserve it, and you'll be a better person for it. Promise.,Best chai ever.,The last two times I've returned to Solo Cafe, I've brought friends.  Each of these friends have remarked that their drinks were the best coffee they'd ever had.  I have to agree that the espresso drinks are absolutely perfect.  I wish they were open later, but the quality of the drinks, the very friendly staff, and the atmosphere still makes this my favorite coffeehouse in Arizona.,I have been frequenting this place for years now, and it just occurred to me to write a review. 

I love the tea lattes at Solo! I took my BFF for a JASMINE NECTAR and now she is obsessed. The atmosphere is awesome, as are the baristas. It is a great place to study quietly, or to just chill. 

I do agree that the chemical smell from the salon can be overpowering when they go in and out through the connecting door, but I also love the fact that the husband owns the coffee shop and the wife owns the salon. It makes me happy to see both their businesses flourishing. Maybe now that they are more established, and doing well, they will extend their weekend hours.,I'm always looking for a good coffee shop in the East Valley. I really like Gold Bar down the road, but decided to give this place a try.
I came in on a Sunday evening this November and, despite there not being many cars in the lot, the place was fairly full. I'm not sure where these people came from.
There's a bench against the wall with tables and single chairs perpendicular. Another couple of tables are on the other side of the room for slightly larger groups. The bottom of the bench offers lots of outlets for working, and there is free wifi, although it requires a code from the staff.
The coffee was terrible, but I wasn't looking for gold exactly. It was served in a glass, which is nice (I hate when they serve ""for here"" drinks in the disposable mugs). They were also playing what sounded like a Styx' greatest hits CD overhead but, after I asked about it (I honestly was not complaining, just curious), switched it out to some cheese pop. It was also butt-ass hot in there. Sure, it's November, but it still gets warm in Phoenix. How about a swamp cooler?
What ticked me off about the place was that they don't give discounted refills: you have to pay full price for another cup. I haven't seen many places do that and, if they do, I don't go there again. $3.50 for two cups of bad coffee is a little much.
Nice atmosphere though, and it's a nice strip mall with a popular burrito place next door.,Well-executed coffeshop.  Plenty of seating and unlike most places they have free wireless; comfortable and light atmosphere.  They stated",0.318454801
Sola Coffee Bar,"Cool atmosphere, tastey coffee and tea, friendly staff.
Nice place to grab a cup , sit outside, and people watch before strolling the many shops.,Excellent coffee and espresso made by knowledgable baristas. Not often does hip and comfortable meet the quality demands of truly great coffee, but this place hits the mark on all counts. I highly recommend going here!,Two words:

Record Player,I've been here about three times now and I always get a delicious coffee.  Sometimes I pick out what I'd like to drink and once i let the barista decide for me... Thats how i came to try the agave latte which was pretty good! The coffee is reasonably priced and really really tasty. Its smooth and doesn't have the almost burnt flavor that starbucks does. I've also had biscotti from here, which is delicious, but comes from an outside baker.  My only complaint is that they are closed on Sundays, so i'm usually limited to Saturdays for my Sola experience.,One of the few boutique coffee joints in the city.   Fantastic!,It's a bit out of my way, but it's nice to find a local coffee shop in Scottsdale amidst all the chain places. I've ordered lattes there a couple of times, and they always turn out wonderful: the coffee flavor comes through nicely and isn't burnt-tasting like every Starbucks beverage I get seems to be. Go local!,We went here mid morning on Monday, they have an incredibly cute atmosphere with really interesting artwork and very friendly staff. I love the little hanging clouds and stars in particular! I asked for green tea and they had a selection which included a Rose Green Tea for Valentines Day so I tried it out, it was VERY fragrant and soothing, if you get in in February I'd definitely give it a try! The comfy couches with pillows and safes for end tables make this eclectic little shop worth a stop in to say the least.,this place is really cool. i love the concrete floors. free wi-fi? i try to stay somewhat disconnected....
the staff....so friendly and gregarious. they talk to their customers like they're old pals. i was so surprised to see how they brew the coffee. my mom has made her coffee like that ever since i can remember. when i made it like that, i just assumed that's how coffee was brewed. alas, work, women, dog....had to get a coffee maker. so when i saw sola's technique, boy did it bring back memories. 
the only thing that kept away the extra star were the hours. wish they opened earlier than 8am and also on sundays. i love that i can ride over there on my bike, but by 8am (and not at all on sundays), i'm already at work!,Big fan. I drop by when i can.  Call me crazy but I like to actually taste the coffee.  As an avid coffee drinker and more of a purist i luv the turkish and drip style (makes me long for Blue Bottle).  

Not much on atmosphere but quiet, cozy and a good place to get quality java drinks.  Barista 'DJ' knows how to make them right!,CARTEL COFFEE LAB  has assumed proprietorship of Sola Coffee Bar and is providing espresso addicts with uber-excellent, thick- crema libations made by using a deceptively small La Marzocco machine---TRY IT !,I spent a couple of hours in this place today. Ordered a Guatemalan coffee, my first ever, and it was great. The staff was extremely knowledgeable about their products and very helpful in making choices when I felt like trying something different.  They have free Wi-Fi and didn't care that I took up space on one of their small tables for two hours.  There was one guy with a laptop there longer than me. They have two long tables with floor electrical outlets for charging and a couple of outlets next to tables along the wall. They also have a nice, comfy couch and chair area where people can meet and talk... if you're not the classic introvert like me who would rather have her nose in a computer.  This place is clean, minimalist, and professional.  When I return to Scotsdale, this will be the place I stop for good, quality coffee and accommodating atmosphere.  I hope they keep up the good work!,Posh yet cozy interior, FANTASTIC espresso (and there are options!! get the finca alaska if they have it...citrus & blueberry undertones. wow.), giant biscotti:), knowledgeable & friendly baristas. A great coffeeshop. Wish it was in my neighborhood....,Had to downgrade my rating as Sola has changed their chai to a formula. It is no longer the deliciously brewed goodness that they used to buy from Lux. =( Still, I perservere and ask everytime I'm in if they've reverted back to the chai that was once oh so delightful. Til then... I will have to stick w/ my iced almond milk decaf hazelnut & vanilla latte.,Sola is tasty toddy and pretty cappuccinos and a nice Alexis and bare walls and concrete floors and cool haircuts. 

It's LUX without pretension; humility goes a long way for me.,LOVER of this place. seriously, such a great place. Drinks do take awhile but they are worth it. Awesome cappuccinos and the best reason ever to come here, COCONUT & ALMOND MILK. I try to avoid dairy at all costs (and soy) and besides Whole Foods & The Center Bistro no coffee places ever have coconut or almond options. They also have a delicious dark chocolate sauce, yum! 
The ambiance is unbeatable, so friendly- couches, newspapers, magazines, best place to spend an afternoon or evening. And on top of all of that, they are non profit! Definitely check this gem out :),LOVE LOVE LOVE.  Fantastic coffee shop with fantastic atmosphere.  The staff plays great music!  the best part about sola is the fact that the staff seem like they actually want to be there too.  I find at other coffee shops (places in general) that the employees are simply counting down the seconds till clock-out.  Here, the staff seems like they enjoy the coffee shop, its patrons and are proud of it. Just great. 

I am a huge fan of the Turkish brewing method they offer here.  They use cardamom as well and its absolutely fantastic.  I love trying new places as often as I can but I keep coming back to Sola because I crave their Turkish style coffee. 

I don't know why anyone would pick the Starbucks in Old Town when Sola is just a few blocks up!,Decaf espresso in the house!!! 

After multiple visits to Sola and a variety of drinks, it's safe to say that we're huge fans. And the great thing is that they're doing decaf espresso now too so the expecting moms now don't need to go without.

Big fan of the Haitian vanilla latte.,Great non-touristy coffee shop in the heart of Old Town. Free wifi & plenty of outlets make it perfect for working on weekdays. Solid cappuccino but not many pastry options. No set menu means I've paid a different price for the lime Italian soda each of the 3 times I ordered it. Not for those who like the options and structure of a Starbucks, but it makes me nostalgic for my college coffee hangout.,Great spot for some good coffee in Old Town Scottsdale.  
The decor is clean and inviting and the coffee is great.  Good selection of drip coffees and some very tasty muffins available as well.,Another coffee bar... whoopie. These are a dime a dozen now in Phx... and nothing changes.  This place gets 2* only because they have some unique milk drinks like coconut (real milk - no flavoring), etc - otherwise it would get only 1*

In all it is a concrete, bare, store front with no aesthetic appeal that serves coffee drinks and had little to no A/C running in the AZ summer heat... wow, so unique ;),I found myself hanging around the area in serious need of a good cup of coffee. I found Sola while walking around and loved that it wasn't overly-trendy or packed. Their lattes rock and they have a banana nut latte (always light on the syrup for me!) that warms my soul.

It's currently run by a church (wha?) but the news has leaked that his little gem is soon to be a Cartel establishment. Woo!!! They already use Cartel coffee, so it just seems like a natural progression.

There are so many cool things about Sola.

1. They are using the old Food Bar coffee cups. A little feeling of nostalgia and the greenie in me just loves it.

2. The environment is comfortable. Long community tables...long couches....books...simple = comfy. It hasn't been overly crowded when I've been there so the space worked for me.

3. They make a darn good Latte.

I've made my way back a few times since I discovered it and can't wait to hang out and make it my mobile office for the day!,I've gone here twice now because of a Groupon. But I have to say, I'm not impressed. Both times the server wasn't very friendly and the drinks were expensive and not well made.,I utilized Sola as a meet up spot with several friends over the past few months.  Obviously, I did this because I feel it is a place worthy of sharing with people I care about!  I'll be honest though...I haven't strayed further than their iced toddy.  If you love coffee, you'll love it.  if you don't love coffee, you'll love it too!  Cold brewing coffee like they do for the iced toddy takes away a lot of the acidity of normal coffee drinks.  Seriously, you have to try it.  I add a bit of milk and raw sugar...so refreshing.  (Which may not be what you're looking for on this blustery, freezing day...but just sayin!)

They have free wi-fi and the place never seems to be too full, which is nice.  Kind of reminds me of coffee bars we used to hang out and ""study"" in in college.  

Baristas are nice..sometimes just seem to be a little distracted but I don't really mind.  It is much better than Starbucks where I get an eye roll and a slammed lid if i ask for a little caramel on top.  Way more relaxed and cool here.  

Support local coffee shops, PLEASE!  :),Sola is the first Coffee shop that I've found in Old Town Scottsdale that isn't a copy of a Starbucks. Their coffee is wonderful, the staff is pleasant, and their pastries are delicious. 

As a Real Estate Agent specializing in assisting Buyer's in Central Phoenix, Scottsdale, and Tempe I frequently meet clients here as it is more laid back than a Starbucks, has free WiFi, and is a great place to meet clients since it's so centrally located. Not to mention the great cup of Joe I get to share with my clients. 

If you're in the mood for something different try substituting milk with almond milk, it's delicious.,Cool little spot in the heart of Oldtown. Good vibe. Only downside is it could be a tad more comfortable.  I'm a big fan of plopping down at a comfortable coffee shop, staying for a while and knocking out some work.  The seats here can make that a bit of a challenge.

They do have a few seats outside and free WiFi.

Good spot with a very friendly, helpful staff and excellent coffee and tea.,This place is amazing. I go out of my way to get coffee here because they can make my lattes with coconut milk. LOVE. They also use Cartel coffee. Doesn't get much better than that!,Friendly, knowledgeable staff.
Quaint decor, leans toward pdeudo-industrial - but is well kept.

Quick order taken and drink delivered.
This location uses roast from Cartel Coffee Labs.

The mocha was very tasty, but there was a slightly metallic taste to it. After some biscotti (ew, raisins) - I tried a single shot. Same metallic taste. I think the issue is the water. 

Tastes a bit like softened water instead of RO purified. Fix the water and an easy four star.,Smack in the middle of the most touristy place in Scottsdale, Sola has enough nerve to run this most un-touristy of coffee houses.  Next time you've had it with all the rental cars and out of staters on Scottsdale Rd., indulge yourself in some real entertainment by sitting outside Sola for a while.  Watch as They Who Have No Business Wearing Shorts But Do So Anyway casually work their way through the 5th Ave shops then suddenly spot Sola up ahead.  Stop dead in their tracks and crane their necks to get a better look just to be sure - Gasp!  That's not a Starbucks!  And no squash blossoms either!  And just look at the clientle - 60 degrees out and no shorts among them!  You can get rich betting your friends $5 for every tourist that crosses the road to steer clear of Sola.,After hearing about Sola for what seems like ages (in actuality they've only been open since last November), I finally made my way in early this morning.

I was up early for a 6am workout and decided to swing by Sola after that... if only I could find it!  It's hidden!  After several drive bys and a call to my husband to make sure I was in the right place, I spotted it (on the north side of 5th Avenue in between Stetson and Scottsdale).  By the time I went up to the door, it was around 7:20.  Unfortunately, the door was locked.  Just my luck...

I peeped inside to see someone and he nodded and made his way over to open the door.  He opened it and told me they don't officially open until 8am but he invited me in anyways... nice!

I found out that this man was Jared (he's referenced in some of the other reviews), and he was extremely friendly, especially considering it was before open hours.  

Jared me me a beautiful looking Cafe Americano with just the right amount of steamed soy per my request.  It tasted even better than it looked!

My one complaint is that the only fake sweetener they had was the yellow kind (Splenda), and I prefer the pink kind.  But lucky for me, I was heading home, so I added it there.  Other than that, I'm a huge fan... and I'm especially feeling good after finishing my cup of joe this morning; it's going to be a productive Monday, I can tell!

I know that Sola  supports the Old Town community, and I'm excited to have an indy coffee shop right around the corner... I will be back!,I am a HUGE FAN of this place!  All caffeine lovers have to try it at least once.  

4 shots in every drink with no additional shot charges!  

Located in the heart of Old Town, a.k.a. My Hood!  

They also sell $12.50 gift cards for only $10.  You save $2.50 instantly.  

Only cons - 

Be patient, drinks this great take a little more time to make.  

Not open on Sundays.,really hip coffee joint with cool music. Vintage yet modern I think it's a hispers dream. Coffee is fresh and the staff is friendly. The location of sola is right in the middle of the creepy part of old town scottsdale, but don't let that detour you from visiting. It is also a great place to just sit and surf the we with their free wifi.,You know how it is...you have been working all morning...on the phone...on the web...answering emails, IM's...on Skype with the euro's...you really need to get out of the office and clear your head, no matter how gilded, plush and well appointed that particular cage is!

You need to get out in the real world...""rub shoulders"" with the masses...you know...""press the flesh"" with the hoi polloi:)

BTW, those are both euphemisms, as I have discovered through trial and error (not to mention lengthy lectures about ""boundaries"" and ""personal space"" from various law enforcement officials and other members of the legal profession:)

So I filled my backpack with my notebook and its power source, my aircard (wifi is great, but a little unreliable at times), my notepad (the paper one...no power cord needed), the folio that my notepad lives in, various pens and pencils (including my beautiful blue Parker fountain pen), post-its, my bluetooth earpiece for my phone, my phone, my newspaper, my current book and my reading glasses.

Whew!...That backpack was full as a tick and ready to pop...you know, it's always the same problem...you finally get your sh*t together...then you discover that it's too heavy to lift:)

Anyway, off I went to Sola for a little slice of humanity and a couple of cups of extraordinary coffee!

Sola is a lovely little spot to spend an hour or two, sitting at one of the big tables, enjoying the conversations around you, the soft music playing, the hissing of the espresso machine as the delightful owners make the various coffee and tea concoctions...and a really extraordinary cup of coffee!

At Sola, they always grind the beans fresh when I ask for a cup...then they put a single cup filter (with the perfect amount of fresh ground beans) on top of the cup...then they pour perfectly heated water into the single cup filter and let it percolate into the cup for a perfect cup of coffee...that's right...I said ""perfect""!

I know, there are cappuccino and espresso and latte enthusiasts out there saying ""Donald, you just described a mere cup of coffee...it's not the caramel macchiato with whipped cream ambrosia that I usually drink!""

Well, I hear you...and I would be willing to bet that those kinds of coffee drinks are also excellent at Sola...but...I like my regular cup of coffee and I enjoy my cup of coffee at Sola more than any other single cup of coffee that I can recall...esp. given that I pay Sola about what I would pay for a large cup of crappy coffee from Charbucks:)

The coffee at Sola is never sitting in an urn...never on the heat...never not perfectly fresh and well made (I know...double negative...but artistic license wins out over correct grammar:)

Add in the fact that the people working at Sola are so nice, pay so much attention to detail in making my coffee and that they have created such a nice spot to relax, work and enjoy my coffee...well, I will submit that it is worth your time to swing through Old Town and discover Sola:)

If you see me at Sola, you are welcome to ""rub shoulders"" with me but please don't ""press my flesh""...I bruise easily these days:),I went to Sola Coffee Bar for the first time today and am already a huge fan.  I asked for an iced coffee, and they said, ""how about a toddy?""  Dude, bring it.  Nice flavor, not overly-bitter, very nice.  I still needed more caffeine, knowing I had significant work to be done tonight, and went back inside and asked for a french press.  ""You mind if I share it with you?""  Dude, I wasn't going to be able to drink the whole thing anyway, so what do I care?  They charged me a whopping $1.50 for it.  After four minutes, my coffee is poured in a mug and I'm chatting with a guy behind the counter for about ten minutes about burr grinders.  Yep, that's right, totally nerding-out while they show me their hand-crank burr grinders from Japan that they sell.

I was hanging out outside the whole time while I was there, enjoying the beautiful weather and listening to two chicks talk about raw food, community gardens, yoga, meditation, hemp, and a bunch of other all-important topics while checking the Twitter stream via the free wifi.  

How in the hell could I not like this place?  I will be back here constantly.  Check this place out.  

BTW, they serve and sell Cartel Coffee.,Its a nice little coffee shop with free wifi.  I'm not a big coffee drinker, so I can't attest to the coffee, it was about the same for me..  I didn't like that they didn't have a lot of pastry choices.  I'm usually not very hard to entice into getting a pastry with my coffee but the 3 times I went there, I just wasn't into the choices they had.  :\,Love this place. I can't wait until they're open on Sundays. Walked in late afternoon to grab a cappuccino. It was one of the best cappuccinos I've ever had; I'm not exaggerating. The space is very hip and cool looking. I will definitely be coming here more often.,Sola is near my office which is hardly the only reason I visit this wonderful coffee shop, it is the process by which the Sola staff makes the coffee.  The beans are ground right before the coffee is made which makes for a delicious cup of joe.  The staff is friendly, the beans are fresh and the pastries are quite good.  Free wifi is available too!,Since moving out West from Austin, TX...which is home to some damn fine coffee purveyors...I've been looking for the perfect combo of ambiance, yummy coffee, great staff (not overly cheerful, not overly angsty) and comfort.  Sola, doesn't meet all my specs, but comes on close.  

The ambiance is great.  It's industrial in nature.  While it is located in a pretty touristy area, it still has the hole in the wall feel.  I'm not sure if they rotate their art installments.  I hope so because the current pieces are on par with my 9th grade notebook doodles.  Not sure what the kids behind the counter were spinning off the MacBook, but it was good...current, hip, indie, mellow, easy to Yelp to!

I ordered a non fat latte which I thoroughly enjoyed.  It was better than the Bucks or the Bean.  The rest of the menu looked good.  If I had been to the gym this morning I may have tried something a little sweeter or one of the treats from under the glass domes on the counter.

The guys behind the counter were great.  They were friendly and funny, but not over the top cheerful which can be annoying in the morning.  They are both really attentive to the customers and take care of business while having fun at the same time!  I can tell these guys enjoy their job and working with each other.  Ive been pretty amused listening to them talk about music.  If I were 17 again, I would probably want to work here with kids like these.  They have good attitudes that transcend the over all feel of the venue.  (it's funny that they have no idea I'm writing about them right now!)

As for comfort....total bust!!!!  F-.  This place is all hard surface.  Forget sinking in with a good book or an hour of surfing the inter web.  There are two couches but they aren't comfy at all...probably worse than the upright chairs at the tables.  I've been more comfortable waiting for my car at Jiffy Lube.  

Will I come back?  Yeah....probably.  I'll check out some other places first though.,ATMOSPHERE: Small quaint coffee shop with the industrial, modern feel. Large and small desks near outlets and couch seating available. Diverse crowd. Not too crowded on a Saturday morning. Many people with their laptops including me getting work done. 
COFFEE: I ordered a skim latte. Nothing spectacular or out of the ordinary and it was good. 
PARKING: At times can be sparse but you can usually find a free spot on the street with a 3h limit.
PERKS: Free wireless!
LOCATION: Located in the 5th Ave shops area of Olde Towne Scottsdale. 
SERVICE: Very good. No complaints here. 
CONCLUSION: Nice, open space with free wireless and on par coffee to go and study. I will be back!,I like this place so much for the vibe and the laid back atmosphere.  It's a great place to just chill out and chat, although there are occasionally a few people who are a little too relaxed for me.  Like the chick with her shoes off, reclining on the couch, bare feet and all.  Or the mom who had a meeting and let her son run rampant, including out the front door, and let him harass other kids with a handful of straws.  That being said, I'm very happy to have this place so close to home.

I didn't give it the fifth star, because while the milk is always perfectly creamy, it's often not hot, and I know I might get shot for this, Cartel is not my favorite coffee.  Also, there is one woman who charges double or triple for drinks from what most of the guys charge. 

Baked goods also are fresh and get a big thumbs up.,Lets start with the positives...

Pros:
-Not Starbucks
-Great location in Old Town Scottsdale and surrounded by lots of fun shopping/browsing
-Great atmosphere/interior

And thats about it. Now for the negatives.

Cons:
-The service was mediocre at best. When I have to greet the person helping me first, I internally come a little undone. 
-Yes there is a lot of seating, but it is overly awkward. I don't feel like cuddling with strangers on a couch while i'm trying to enjoy my coffee or stare deeply into some random persons eyes from a cross a long table where we are both trying to use our laptops.
- The coffee wasn't anything to rave over and after mediocre/almost shitty service, the coffee better rock my pants off.

In my experience, there is nothing about this place that would bring me back. A barista with zero customer service skills with an attitude that screams ""because we are a trendy coffee shop in Scottsdale I don't need to go out of my way to be kind to you"". Well, sir, yes you do.

If you are in the area and need a place to grab a coffee and hang out with a friend by all means, give this place a go! Hopefully you have a better experience than I did.,I like good coffee, this place makes good coffee... tried the Americano and the cappuccino. However, if you're looking for something to eat (eg bagel, scone, biscotti, croissant, etc.) the pickens are very slim. 

Also, have to agree with other reviews, the place is not comfy. Hard back chairs, concrete floor, and industrial tables.,Incredible coffee. Roasted by the folks over at Cartel, it is a great place in the art district of Scottsdale, so we will usually go out there on date night and have a coffee and walk around. 

Staff is always fantastic. Chalkboard menu wall is nice. I don't work on that end of town, but if I did, I would hang there a lot more. Prices are good.,LOCATION:  Located in the 5th Ave shops in Olde Towne Scottsdale. 

ATMOSPHERE: This place is a small quaint coffee shop with large and small tables.  There are small tables near power outlets for folks who want to bring in their laptops.  It seems to be a great place to study!  We were there on a Saturday morning and found that our timing was perfect.  The lunch crowd arrived shortly after we did.  However, it was still a comfortable and relaxing atmosphere.  The crowd is very diverse which I like!  

COFFEE:  We had a chai latte and a banana nut mocha.  Additionally, we had a chocolate muffin which was quite good!  Both were very good and foamy!   

PARKING:  We were fortunate to find a spot in front of Sola.  However, it looks like patrons most often need to park along the streets in Olde Town.  

PERKS:  Options for brewing and free wireless internet!

SERVICE:  You can tell that the business was designed by a true coffee connoisseur as we had four options for brewing.  The gentleman behind the counter was very friendly.   

CONCLUSION:  Very nice and even romantic.  I can't wait to come back!  It's location near the mall area makes Sola a must visit!,I've spent several afternoons at Sola and I can say that it's been a positive and comfortable experience each time. Situated in a nice area, the staff is friendly and I am able to conduct a meeting or get my work done privately. The coffee (both hot and cold) is excellent. The peppermint mocha was like Christmas in my mouth. I can't wait to see what they offer in the spring and summer!,My search for a non-chain coffee bar in Old Town Scottsdale may FINALLY be over!!  I don't know how many times I've passed Sola without going inside, but I'm glad I did this morning.

I'm a residential real estate agent, and was going to meet clients of mine for coffee.  We all agreed Starbucks was out of the question, so I suggested we try Sola, since I had heard good things about it and haven't been very impressed by any of the other coffee bars in Old Town.  Sola did not disappoint!

The interior is minimalist, but I appreciate that.  I don't really want my coffee bar to be loaded with kitch and merchandise for sale.  Sola had a little bit of art on the walls, comfortable places to sit (could be more, though), and good, quiet music playing on the record player - yes, record player!!  The coffee was incredibly tasty, but the time it took to be prepared was the ONLY MINOR reason for my review being reduced from 5 stars to 4.

Sola is still new, though, so I'm going to assume the good people behind the bar will get their coffee prep times down quickly.  Just be patient, and your delicious coffee will be served with a smile.  Oh, and while you wait, have one of the pastries they serve (made by Scratch)!!!",0.248474043
Royal At The Market,"1/30/10

2.5 stars.

Stopped in while waiting for food to cook at the market next door.  Cute little space.  The cookies looked delicious, but as soon as I asked my standard questions, the baristas went on the defensive, and I lost the cozy, warm feeling I had upon entering.  The latte I chose tasted great.,Great little coffee bar!

It was packed when I was there, and they were still able to make my drink fast. They make one delicious caramel macchiato.,I wanted to try different place for coffee the other morning and found Royal at The Market.  I went in through the Market to get my cup of joe, but Royal has their own entrance on the side of the building facing the parking lot with a big sign the says ""Coffee"" with an arrow.

The baristas were ok but more interested in flirting with each other rather than serving their late morning caffeine junkies.  I was ok with it but my colleague was irritated and needed her caffeine pronto!  My cup of joe was very good ~ good temp, robust flavor, vibrant aroma with a smooth finish when it hits the back of your mouth.  It was roasted at another location but it tasted very fresh with no bitterness. The chai tea latte was also very good but was not at the best temp and needed to be hotter.  

The decor is very ""earthy"" with a lot of wood and they have maximized their space to accommodate a lot of people with smaller table surface areas.  Neat to look at but not very comfy at all.  Maybe it's a better place to conduct an interview rather socialize with friends...,I'm a big fan of anything the Plus Minus Studio guys do. That includes Royal at the Market. When I heard Royal was opening a second location at the new Urban Grocery (the first has since closed), I was excited to have it just a few blocks away.

The space doesn't disappoint. Although small, it is an excellent example of urban reuse. The wood features are recycled from old flatbed trucks. Some of Plus Minus' beautiful furniture is also on hand, really giving this little cove in the back of the market some character.

Hayes and Co. brew strong yet smooth espresso drinks and Phoenix's best iced coffee. (I said it! Take that, Fair Trade!) The adjacent room is a nice spot to hang out. I'm excited to see what additions they come up with for this room, as I feel it can be a nice co-working spot for some of the downtown coffee faithful.,I will never drink another iced coffee unless it comes from Royal at the Market.  Ever. I promise. Seriously.  If my hot cup of coffee gets lukewarm, I'll be forced to throw it away because then I'd be cheating on you.  And that would be rude and mean.  I'd never hurt your feelings like that. I promise.,w00t! A coffee spot that carries almond milk! Now I know what you must be thinking... ""big deal, almond milk?"" ... but yes, it is a big deal, a VERY big deal. 

You see, 99% of coffee shops choose to solely carry soy milk alone as their non-dairy creamer alternative. Unfortunately, you are currently reading the writings of a vegan who is allergic to soy milk, makes my throat all itchy and sore feeling, but I digress... 

Royal made me happy by offering almond milk and I happily slurped down my iced vanilla almond milk latte while traversing the many wonders of the Phoenix open air public market on Saturday morning.

-1 star since I had to mix up my drink myself.

Take note other coffee shops: please carry another non-dairy creamer besides soy milk.,Just wanted to let everybody know that Royal at the Market is closed for the summer!  In the meantime, be sure to check out the other location at the Biltmore Fashion Park -  Royal at the Biltmore!

(Also, since it's summer - I thought I should mention that the iced coffee is so smooth and amazing that you don't even have to add anything to it!! Don't believe me?  Ask for a sample next time you are here and I guarantee you will be astounded!),Coffee is ridiculous! They roast their own in small batches. It just doesn't get any better than that! The owner is a really cool guy. Tends to give too much away being nice, but that shows how committed he is to future business. The treats are great and I'm sorry for not remembering the name of the baker. Greatest old school hand drawn espresso machine too. Just a great little place with killer self roasted beans.,Smooth, perfectly made coffee.  They have good milk alternatives such as soy and almond milk, and a decent selection of sugar free syrups.  Minus a star because I was hoping to catch up on some reading when I went in the afternoon (around noon on Saturday), but the chairs were already put up on top of the tables.  I thought they were open until 4 PM?,Yippee! My favorite little shop near home! I really should stop here on my way to work, as the places near work are not nearly up to par. The coffee here is much better and occasionally I even catch them while the beans are still roasting out front. 
The quality of the products and the service are hard to beat. The baristas will even take the time and effort to work a nice design into the foam.  I usually get my drinks to go, but the ambiance is great. 

They have become part of my Saturday morning routine, walk to the market, get my coffee/chai/cocoa and a stroll through the farmers/public market. What a way to enjoy a Saturday. 

[A note for first timers here, the entrance is on the West side of  The Phoenix Public Market, NW of the main Market entrance, It can be a little inconspicuous and since the market opens later than Royal, the locked Market door may deter some.],The coffee is really really really good.  So good you don't care about anything else.,Great coffee, I mean great. We get it every week while waiting for Matt's Big Breakfast to open up and I always guzzle down whatever delicious concoction I get. They make hot cocoa at a drinkable temperature (for my 7 year old) and they even do the artsy leaf thing with the foam on top, on the cocoa too! They have curious and amazing bacon filled treats like bacon brownies (and today we tried bacon scones, YUM) along with a really adorable seating arrangement attached to an eclectic 'whole foods' type shop. They are right along side Phoenix Public Market and provide the service of having the only bathroom in the area which they also deserve mad props for. This is a definite must if you're in the area and especially if you're going to brave the long wait outside of Matt's!!,Yay - another indie coffee joint that's somewhat near work! Bonus, I can shop at the market at the same time. Well, sometimes. I usually go for coffee between 8:00 am and 9:00 am, and the market doesn't open until 11:00 am. But it happens once in a while.

Anyway, you can tell that Royal takes their coffee very seriously. Often, they have the roaster going out front. If you order drip coffee, be prepared to wait. They brew it right then, one cup at a time.  But it's worth it. 

The espresso is also rich and delicious.  I made the mistake of going to back to Starbucks once, and the americano now tastes like ash in comparison. Royal has spoiled me!,My most favorite coffee in Phoenix.  And I'm a coffee snob.  Because I loooooove coffee.  Hayes also makes a tasty bowl of oatmeal too.  Served with raisins + walnuts + brown sugar.  Mmmmmm...  

My son used to go to school nearby so I was there almost every morning.  I miss it.  Especially the smell...  

Most things (quoting Tom Robbins) are either YUCK or YUM.

Royal at the Market is 100% YUM!,Great espresso, delicious baked-goods. Beware, though, you MUST order very slowly, and be sure to enunciate. And maybe ask the counter person to repeat the order back to you. Otherwise, you may end up with a bowl of oatmeal swimming in espresso. And delivered to your table 30 minutes after you ordered.,I have had coffee all over AZ (and other states) and this is my second favorite place in AZ.  As far as Phoenix goes this is #1!  I love their coffee and tea.  The cookies and other baked goods are also wonderful.  Plus the staff is great.  Hayes has done a wonderful job making this a cozy eco-friendly place.,Always a great place to meet a friend for a coffee. The atmosphere is great for a conversation and there is always the patio on the side of the Market for an outdoor experience. I really enjoy the Americanos and soy cappuccinos at Royal. The service is always fast and the coffee is great.,Nice! This is a great little shop connected to the Phoenix Urban Public Market (which is actually just a cool little indie grocery store, don't get excited thinking it's like Pike Place or something). The coffee is good - strong, never bitter, and obviously roasted by those in the know. The baristas know what they are doing, always delivering handcrafted espresso beverages made with care. The atmosphere is great, too. Comfortable seating area for you to get some work done, socialize, or chill for a bit before doing a little grocery shopping. High top tables, community tables, and there is also a small outdoor area for when you can sit out without roasting ... like coffee beans.

I've never had any pastries here, but they look tasty. I've also been to the Royal location at The Biltmore and had equally great coffee.

I probably would come here more when I'm in Central PHX, but for the fact that it's a little further from my other favorites and I don't shop at The Market very often. However, the location is super convenient off the light rail and there is plenty of parking.,Had another great visit to Royal Coffee...  Makes a great stop while shopping the Phoenix Public Market.  Hayes has great coffee and serves it up quickly, even when it's busy.

I like the location and the area... Royal Coffee makes a perfect base to explore the market and beyond.,My favorite coffee in town. While other places may have the speciality beans that wow you every now and then, Royal's self-roasted blend is consistently great--whether it is their hot pour overs or iced toddy.  

Hayes and his staff go the extra mile to serve you without the indifference or even worse,coffee talk gobbledygook or condescension of some other places.  

I love the urban, adaptive-use nature of the place with  modern yet organic, custom made furniture.

Best yet, it has become a hub for downtown denizens and urbanites. I never fail to see a familiar face when I stop by. It's a great way to remain connected with the who what when and where of downtown Phoenix.,By far the best coffee in downtown Phoenix. I absolutely adore their scones as well.  

I really wish they were open on Sundays!,Hayes is amazing. I'm not a coffee drinker, but I do love the smell of coffee and you can smell Hayes' coffee from around the block. Just follow your nose and you'll find his cute shop. I always get the jasmine green tea, really unique and tasty! I love going into Royal because the staff there always make me feel welcome and treat me like a regular, even though I only go every couple of months when I'm in the area. My sister who came to visit has fallen in LOVE with the Royal's cold brew coffee and I have since purchased 3 bags for her and sent them to her because she wont drink any other. That's gotta say something!,I always get great customer service and great coffee. I've been going here for years.,My wife loves it, whereas I think it's perfectly fine. What I don't get (and one of my other favorites does this too) is why I'm waiting for the single-cup drip coffee and paying extra for it. I think this is the coffee shop equivalent to expensive yet average table side guacamole. But I digress... Back to Royal, I think this place is decent, although I think I'd pick Cartel over it for a morning or afternoon cup of joe. The only reason I end up at Royal is if I'm already at Phoenix Public Market or I need a coffee downtown between the hours of 6:00 PM and 8:00 PM on a Wednesday (which probably means I'm at the market).,Sadly, the place closed a few months ago.,I am a barista, so I'm pretty particular about the way my coffee is made and how it tastes. 
Royal has knocked it out of the park on several occasions, both in quality of my drink and in quality of service.

1st visit- I ordered just a plain ol' cup of coffee. Each cup is brewed to order. No gross 2 hour old coffee sitting in a pot on a warming plate here. It was good coffee, rich and nutty. My daughter got a hot chocolate, which she enjoyed thoroughly. 
2nd visit- My daughter and I came in on a Wednesday night while getting dinner at the food trucks. The line was REALLY long. The barista seemed to keep her cool and even though people were kind of just standing about waiting to order their coffee (make a line, people!), she kept a good eye on who came in and when and knew exactly who to serve next.
My latte was good, and the milk was steamed well. The barista was very sweet and had a really good attitude. My only criticism of this visit was that my daughters drink wasn't really hot. It was actually a little on the cold side. My daughter is 10, but likes her hot chocolate HOT.

I go in here once a week. 9 times out of 10 I am greeted promptly and my coffee has been made with little to no mistakes. I don't think it's worth a trip from somewhere far away, there are great coffee houses all over the valley, but if you're downtown I would go in and order a drink. They really know what they're doing.,Better than Fair Trade, not quite as good as Cartel - though Royal's location and hours are better, and the seating area is more conducive to random people interactions, which I like  :),the toddy here is exceptional. i asked for a iced americano and the barista suggested i give the iced coffee a try, so i obliged and it was exceptional. just the look for it made me inquire. ""how do you make the iced coffee here?"" she started to explain, and i was like.. ""ahh so it's a toddy"". 

i'm all over this place now. 2.20 for a 20oz iced coffee..what?? yea..,This is my first review. I've been one to use yelp to help identify restaurants and services in cities I've visited. I figure it is time to contribute a bit back to the community.

I live in the neighborhood and have lots of choices for coffee within a short walk. Royal is becoming my favorite because of quality of coffee, ambiance, and service. 

The coffee roasted on premise is always a plus to me. The depth and nuance of the coffee flavors is always a enjoyable regardless of the technique used to make the coffee. 

The space is small and seemingly ever changing with additions (and deletions) of seating, tables shelves and art. At first glance the space seems small and dark but In its own way the space feels comfortable. It is difficult to describe.   

Royal is staffed with helpful perky people who seem to offer a smile or nice word regardless of how busy it is. Royal can be slow if it is busy but the patrons are interesting to speak to and the place has a unhurried vibe. If you stop by in the afternoon or evening it is especially pleasant. 

It is nice to have Royal in the neighborhood.,I discovered Royal at the Market in October of 2009 on a visit to the Saturday morning farmer's market. Though I do enjoy coffee drinks, I am a chai lover...and this place has the best chai in town! Since then I have made Royal my Saturday morning treat, stopping for my tea and then perusing the market for tasty treats! A wonderful place to stop and a great location to hang out!,Just about everything that makes a coffee shop good is lacking here.

1) uncomfortable chairs (what the HELL!? Sure they look ""cool"" but they are really really are uncomfortable)
2) roasting beans inside which just REEKS
3) lack of a decent number of outlets for laptops

And for the coffee ... just middle of the road ...,What can i say about this little gem that hasn't been said? So many positives. so few negatives. i guess the only 2 negatives i have are these; 1) it takes about 10 minutes to get a drip coffee on Saturday when the farmers market is going nuts. 2) there is no ""line"". much like all things hippie, it's free form. meant to be self regulated (which, in all honesty, I'm OK with after your 1st visit or if its not busy). be prepared to make Friends while asking who is in line and who has ordered their delicious treat already. seating is cool, patio rocks. and its attached to the little store (which I'm not reviewing in this review). if we had half stars, i would give it a 4.5. i may round up after trying it out on a non-market day. but if you go on Saturday, like i said, expect those 2 tips up top and you wont look like a banker that belongs inside a Starbucks (who, me? nah). BTW, service is amazing!,LOVE this coffee shop. What a perfect pairing being located in the market (another place I like to visit as often as possible). The coffee is wonderful and the service is always fast and friendly. The baked goods they offer change regular (read: super fresh) and are always so tempting. Great place to work too, unless it's a Saturday morning, because then it's packed (understandably). If you like coffee, this is a must-try.,Great place for coffee and a quiet place to get some work done.

Lots of chairs and recycled tabletops. Not too many outlets though.

The Italian sodas are pretty good as well.,A coffee shop is good when...

1. they serve delicious caffeinated beverages 
2. they offer tasty treats to soothe your hunger pains
3. they provide sufficient room to get work done. 

Royal at the Market offers all three. The coffee is creamy, and full of a caffeinated kick which is the perfect boost to the day. I like iced coffee and enjoy their iced latte here. They have plenty of pastries to munch on and more important, the Downtown Public Market is just a step through a pair of doors. Finally, they have plenty of seating where it's easy to get work done. They have community tables as well as individual high tops. They also have a back room with seating as well.  

Between the Market and Royal at the Market, this is an ideal spot to visit for a beverage and to do some work and I like to visit as often as I can.,One of my favorite coffee places in downtown Phoenix. They have great coffee - I have tried lattes, drip, and cold brew and all have been wonderful. Plus, for those of you bacon lovers, they have been known to make a great bacon brownie on Fridays. Many of their other pastries have been winners too. The atmosphere is really earthy, I really like the cork floor, wood high tops, and the tree looking desk. Its a good place to work or meet up with someone. Plus, the Phoenix Public Market is right next door, and its convenient to grab some coffee before the market on Saturday mornings.,CLOSED?!?!?! Maaaaaan. I pretty much moved downtown JUST to get coffee here....well....maybe that's not true.....but seriously? I am sooo sad this place closed because it is some fine coffee and pastries. I have dreams about their chocolate cupcakes. I went the other day with a friend and they were unusually closed, but no sign....then returned a few days later to see their door covered in paper. Their sign says they are looking to relocate somewhere else in downtown sometime this winter, which I hope is true. Hey Royal! You can open in the open space under the Alta lofts or in the Arizona center if you wanna....just sayin....,Chai tea is great.
Cupcake is good.

The decoration/interior is the best. I love the tables and the doors.
I wish they are opened on Sunday.,I typically only go to Royal when I'm at the Farmers' Market on Saturday mornings.  It's probably their busiest time, but they are pretty efficient, and the wait is never long.  I typically get an iced coffee or skinny latte.  They are tasty, but I am no coffee snob.  I love that there's no ""extra-hot, extra foam, yadda yadda"" b.s., like at some other places.  Inside, it's pretty cramped, and the seating is not comfortable.  Plus, I really dislike high-top tables.  But there are other, more pleasant seating options.  There's inside the Public Market, outside, on the grapevine-festooned patio, or, on Saturday mornings, in the ""food court"" section of the outdoor market, where you also have the added touch of live local music.,This is one of my favorite coffee spots in the Phoenix area. A quaint, little coffee bar in the back of Phoenix Public Market, this place offers coffee, pastries (while they last), and WiFi in a laid-back atmosphere in a single room filled with various works from local artists.

Free, covered parking is available in the lot to the west of the building. However, this lot is reserved after 2 pm on Wednesdays for the Open-Air Market.",0.292389724
Press Coffee Roasters,"Alright! A really good coffee place. So, I went here on my coffee tour of Phoenix (ftw) yesterday with the Bf. He got a hot latte and I got an iced latte. They were both very good. The barista was also very friendly and knowledgeable about coffee. She explained that they have a new espresso machine that uses varying pressures when pulling the espresso shot, which makes for a more smooth coffee. Smooth, it was! Both the iced and hot lattes were not acidic and just had a very pleasant smooth coffee and milk flavor. Also, the foam to latte ratio was very good on the hot version. I will definitely be coming back here.... yum and yum. This may be a new front runner on the coffee tour.,Wonderfully friendly staff. Macchiato was perfect. Upscale shopping area doesn't steal from the appeal they create in here. Had zeppelin playing late at night. Happy and relaxing place. Cool local art too.,Finally I discovered a good coffee shop that is not Starbucks down the street from my house. The coffee here is legit, I had to look up the brewing methods up on my computer after I walked in--I didn't even know that coffee could be something more than burnt beans steeped in water made by some frantic, underpaid kid. 

Oh, but it is so much more than that.

The ladies working today were awesome (I came in on a Friday at about 2:30pm), very friendly, and hustled. 

Glad to have the free wifi, some fresh squeezed OJ, and a tasty delicious coffee.

I am giving it 4 stars, however, for a couple reasons: 

1) they don't make their coffee in glass cups for stay-in orders, and all of their silverware is single-use plastic. I get that businesses do these things for convenience, but I KNOW you have a sink in the back. It's the 21st century and I think it's time we get with the program and cut back on the single-use disposables when they aren't really necessary.

2) I was disappointed with my yogurt parfait. Listen, I get it. This is a coffee shop. MY first mistake was expecting the parfait to be as good as the coffee. It came in a plastic cup with Yoplait yogurt and the granola was a crushed up Nature Valley bar, or something very similar. For the price of over $4, I would really have liked some REAL yogurt and REAL granola without all the HFCS/sugar. A girl can dream, can't she? 

I will know to order something different next time. 

I couldn't help but laugh at some previous comments regarding the ""douchebag"" location. I grew up in this area, so I feel your pain. The a-holes in their Lamborghinis, spoiled children, and plastic robot women are aspects of my going-out experience I would love to do without. But, this is where money is to be made and they sure do make some great coffee. 

4 stars. Make a better yogurt parfait and cut back on the single use disposables!!! :P,Great place! Good change from Starbucks of Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, I must say. 

Plus, how can you beat a foam-milk design of hearts or an angel on your favorite, hot beverage?! Such a nice touch.


Only con for me would be absence of restrooms, but I have noticed that this is a common theme in Scottsdale Quarter establishments. 

Love the fact that they have oversized, leather chairs w/smaller tables as well as the high bistro tables w/high stools.,I'm really bummed that this place is so far away from my house and that it's located in such a douchebag kind of location.  I don't want to see people dressed in clothes that cost more than my car while enjoying a good cup of coffee, and goddamn they serve good coffee.  I've had so much bad coffee in the valley in my first two months here, at places that call themselves coffee shops with ""baristas"" who dump foam onto my cappuccino as if they were a lunchlady unloading a particularly glutinous scoop of mashed potatoes onto my tray.  No thanks.

This place is like heaven.  A Chemex pour-over with my favorite Ethiopian coffee?  Oh yes.  I usually have to cover up Phoenix coffee with a thirty second pour of sugar and a half-gallon of cream, but not here.  I drank it black and relished every smooth drop.  The crazy-ass 18-hour iced coffee on the wall?  Pretentious and awesome.  Love it.

Okay, back to the location.  Why, oh why did you put your shop here?  Were there too many shops in cool locations and you decided that a-holes in Lamborghinis needed better coffee than me?  (I'm not exaggerating about a-holes in Lamborghinis, since one of them couldn't stop looking at my wife's boobs the entire time we ate at True Food).  

I want you to reconsider your poor choice of locations, with my full forgiveness, and open a shop in my garage.  I won't even charge you rent, just a Chemex pour-over every morning.  At the very least open a shop somewhere in central Phoenix.  I'll work for free.

By the way, the two girls who were working today were awesome.  Five stars for them!!!

Four stars because I'm pissed you aren't closer.,Press is located in the Scottsdale Quarter and is a great little spot for something quick and delicious. 

They have excellent coffee - my ""go-to"" is an iced mocha with skim milk. IMO, the coffee is strong! But delicious. 

Better than the coffee are the breakfast sandwiches and burritos - I love that you add a sauce/spread to the sandwich - pesto, sundried tomato, etc . It really adds a nice element that you don't find elsewhere. Additionally, the baked goods: cookies, breads, and muffins, are all yummy, but also calorie-ful. 

Pricing is a little high but not extreme - really it is consistent with the location being in North Scottsdale.

The restaurant has nice seating inside and outside and offers free wifi (the password is ""greatcoffee"". I think they recently swapped out the soft chairs and couches for regular tables/chairs instead. 

Oh! And they have a frequent guest program... no cards/punches, they just take your name each time you get a coffee and you eventually earn a free one. Make sure to mention it each time, as I have had a few that were missed because I didn't bring it up to the cashier.

Service is normally nice - they get quite busy and sometimes it feels a bit rushed, but never rude.

If you're in the Quarter and looking for a nice spot, definitely stop in!,unbelievably good coffee!

the espresso doesn't even need sugar! so good!,I liked the vibe of this place. It reminded me of a few coffee houses I visited in Seattle. The service was friendly and the coffee was great. Be careful with the ""toddy"" though - it's fantastic but will get you wired really quick!,Make sure to stop in if you are in the area. This place is incredible from the service to the product. I love their coffee so much and it is always in a new design of their coffee art. Its cool to have someone take the time to make a $3 latte instead of herding you in and out like Starbucks has become accustomed to. Money well spent! Free wifi too and make sure you grab a snickerdoodle cookie before you leave.,Excellent coffee in the hideaway in Scottsdale Quarter and beats the Starbuck's across the street.,As an update to my last review, though I have not been back, I did want to acknowledge Steve - the owner - who reached out to me and apologized for my experience and said that he has identified the team member that I complained about in my last review (and others have complained too) and he will be working with him to ensure a nicer customer service experience.

Again, I have not been back (I live in L.A.) but I did appreciate the note from Steve, which shows that he is an active and caring business owner and he also included a credit so should I come back, I can have a complimentary coffee, which was extremely kind and generous.,If I could give Press Coffee six stars, I would. They are consistently good, and roast and serve amazing coffee. They make a true classic cappuccino, pour with excellent latte art, and have experienced barista's on staff. Highly recommended.,They made me the best Breve Latte I have had in a good long while.... and the barista made it beautiful! I had to take a picture.

This is a great place to stop into in you are strolling Scottsdale Quarter. I like to go here before I see a movie at the near-by iPic theater.,In my quest for really good coffee shops, I look for 5 things and each get a star if they're up to par. 1. Fresh coffee, 2. breakfast, 3. unique atmosphere, 4. comfort, 5. ambient music. Press has it all...,I hold coffee in high regard, well above religion, food, and everything else.  So when I find a place that makes a truly fantastic espresso, I'm very surprised.  This is certainly in the top five that I've had anywhere in the world.  When you get a macchiato it is not only made with perfectly thick foam, but they give you a nice design on top for that visual appeal.  


On top of that the shop is well lighted because of the big windows and looks clean and inviting.  I use it for short meetings in the area or to get a little work done, and find myself energized and comfortable when I'm working there.,I am used to some good coffee roasters in L.A. so I am a little picky.  It was o.k., but nothing above average.  Latte art - check, nice Scottsdale Quarter mall - check, great taste -  meh....could be better,  friendly employees - check.  Not sure where roasting is done because I could not see it or smell it on the premises.  I did not feel an indie/hipster vibe as Jessica M. stated.  It seemed like run of the mill Starbucks to me.,Yay!  It's not another Starbucks!  How come it took so long for a coffee shop to open in this retail center?  Good coffee, friendly service, and a few treats as well.  Wish it was a bit bigger with more seating but I'll take what I can get.,Came here last Friday after getting into the Phoenix area for Spring Training.  After trying the first time, we came back both Saturday and Sunday morning as well.

The cafe isn't large, but it has a cool mix of modern style with antique touches.  They're rocking some serious coffee and espresso tech - Synesso espresso machine and Bunn Trifecta.  The Synesso is the newer version with some automated pressure profiling, and the Trifecta is new single cup brewer with many controllable variables (Water temp, volume, mixing, etc.) similar in purpose to a Clover, but probably functionally a cross between an aeropress and a siphon.  Probably not for french-press lovers, but great for clarity. Needless to say, you only get these things for your cafe if you really care about coffee and quality.

Coffees tried (and preparation):

Twitch Espresso Blend (Espresso) - Brazil Bruzzi, Ethiopian Harrar, Sumatra Mandheling.  Espresso was pulled around ~1.5oz, with good body.  On Friday it was sweet with a slightly earthy finish, while on Saturday it was sweet blueberries on the front with a chocolate and caramel finish.  Espresso was prepared very well, and was particularly good on Saturday.

(Macchiato) - The blend works really well as a macchiato too - milk chocolate with a hint of berries.  One of the best macchiatos I have had in a while - the baristas really know their craft.

El Salvador Santa Ana Si Beria Bourbon (Espresso) - Delicious sweet front, with a buttery and tasty body, and a citrus/orange finish.  Really nice coffee, and great to have two options for espresso.  Definitely highlights what can be great about Single Origin Espressos.

Ethiopian Nekisse (Trifecta) - Ok, backstory. Sometime last summer, Cafe Grumpy in NYC offered an Ethiopian Nekisse for $12/cup. CBS early show even did a segment on it (http://bit.ly/dbvsTO). This is a similar coffee, and its $4 at Press.  If you appreciate lighter coffees with intense, interesting flavors, do not pass this up. Think, its the same price as a mocha as something.  The aroma was flowery, rose, tea, and blueberries.  The taste was sublime - juicy blueberries, with a tea-like quality. Clean, sweet, with great clarity.

Press Coffee pretty much embodies what every local roaster should aspire to be.  Every time we came, the baristas were inviting, friendly, and put a ton of care into their work. I visit a lot of coffee shops around the west coast, and I have to say that my experience at Press was the best I've ever had. Even the owner was friendly and happy to chat. What sets them apart is how they invite people to experience the coffee in a new way and learn about coffee without being off-putting, pompous, or rude.  They're doing a great job of sourcing good coffees, roasting, and getting the information about the coffee to the consumer.

If you drink coffee and live in the Phoenix area and haven't been here, then you need to asap. I only wish San Diego had a place like this - truly a gem.,Funny story....we were staying at a hotel 5.1 miles away. I know this because google maps told me so. Decided it would be fun to get the cruiser bikes that came with our outrageous ""resort fee"" (because we got 2 hours ""free"" each day) and ride to Press for morning coffee and brekkie.  Got on the bikes, pedaled over to N. Scottsdale Rd and we were on our way! Except.....that....I decided to check our progress after a little while and discovered we had gone the wrong way for a mile and a quarter. Sigh. Turn around, get yelled at by the hubby, kids think it's funny, and off we go. So by the time we got there, we were HUNGRY and THIRSTY! Our 5.1 mile one-way bike ride had become a little more than 7.5 miles.And let me tell you - that cappuccino tasted delicious.

So the next day, we drove. Guess what? Not as good. Still good....just not as good. The coffee was actually lukewarm when we got it. Thinking back, it was that way on the first day also...we were just unusually warm ourselves so didn't much care. Also, there was a bit too much milk for my taste....and I had purposely ordered a triple shot, knowing from the day before that they already put double shots in.  However, to be fair, this is also one of the never-resolved issues I have around wanting more espresso and less milk, but some milk, and foam, but don't want to guide someone through that whole thing. So it's rarely achieved. Except at Temple Coffee in Sacramento...but that's another review. Oh - but the Lemon Poppyseed muffin was the best one I've ever had in my entire life - moist, flavorful and lemony with rind. That was worth the trip right there.

All in all, we'll give it another shot when we're back in town.,Stopped in one Saturday afternoon for an iced Toddy.  The coffee was well-balanced and nutty--no hint of bitterness in this cup!  I spotted a nice selection of full leaf teas and a handful of pastries, but nothing screamed ""EAT ME!""

The staff were friendly enough but kept the interaction to a minimum. It's an ideal spot to stop and relax; that is, if you don't mind battling the traffic of Scottsdale Quarter.  If you're looking for a late night java jolt, head to the Starbucks across the way in Kierland.,Great coffee and very friendly staff!,Great coffee with unlimited refills. I like the place a lot. The wifi is strong and i've never had a problem parking there. It's a good place to get work done and it's not a pick up joint or a high school hang like a lot of coffee shops are turning into. 

The food is also very good and seems to be served all day and night. I like it a lot and give it 5 stars. 

My only problem with it is the nearest bathroom is about a block away.,So as the current Duke of Press, I feel obligated to speak on this local gem.

This is my daily fix. From Coffee to fresh brewed Iced Tea and the best Cappuccino Ive had, Press is fantastic.

The staff is always friendly and super knowledgeable about what they serve.

The valley is lucky to have a homegrown business like this to call its own.,Very solid red eye. Coffee plus espresso plus soy milk. The espresso gives the coffee that lovely crema on top and the soy milk rounds out and softens the flavor. I thoroughly enjoyed sitting out on the sidewalk sipping my coffee and chatting. 

I think I'll have to stop here whenever I come to the Quarter to shop.,High end coffee in a high end shopping strip and neighborhood. cant say it was the best coffee, but it was good. paid a lot of money for a medium latte ($5). Could have gotten a venti at starbucks, lol!,On Saturday afternoon, it was decently quiet, relaxed, clean, and not too packed out. Chai tea was really, really good (if a tad bit expensive)

Their music could use a subwoofer or something for more presence, and could also be a bit louder  with less... Creed or some similar thing. Good headphones make this a relative non-issue.

All in all, seems like good place to get some work done or just relax with friends.,Shame on me. This could be kind of like the suburban coffee messiah of metro Phoenix, and I have missed it until now?! So I waited a long time to check Press out because they aren't close to Central PHX, Biltmore, Tempe, or the Fashion Square area in Scottsdale. NOT A GOOD EXCUSE! I should have come months, even years ago. I should have been here whenever they opened.  Loved the coffee, loved the beverage, loved that they have a Synesso espresso machine (made lovingly down the hill from my house in Seattle), loved that you can get pour over brewed coffee here - and loved having an excuse to walk around and shop in Scottsdale Quarter. 

Smoothest latte made with care. No scalding of the milk. No weak or bitter espresso shots. Just quality. Pour over coffee showcases their beans, which are their own and are roasted locally. Friendly staff, too. I won't be in metro Phoenix as often anymore, but if I am and time permits, I will come back to Press Coffee Roasters. I will probaly even go check out their other location on High Street.

Love in a cup. If you like the sound of that and appreciate quality beans and the craftmanship of an espresso beverage, you will like it here. 

Really would give it 4.5 stars if I could. If I liked the atmosphere inside a little bit more, there were more space, and if they were not so far from Cen Pho I would come all the time - and give them 5 stars. Very good coffee.,Definitely some of the best espresso in all of Scottsdale. My heart belongs to Lux, in Central Phoenix, but this is sooooooo much closer/convenient! 

It has the feel of some of my favorite coffee places in NYC, with that indie/hipster vibe, but seriously high quality espresso. I didn't remember to ask what brand of beans they use, but I know it must be something good because this is some seriously smooth espresso!

I got a soy latte, and just like all of the best places, it's one double-shot, no matter what size you order. I do like that they have a 16oz size just for the people used to ordering a big drink, though. I opted for the 12 oz size and, despite the fact that it was quite warm outside and I was loving indulging in iced beverages while I was back in AZ , I knew that to really get the purest taste, it was best to go with a hot drink.

The owner (?) was also the barista and the cashier. Love that. He was happy to talk to me about the store, and how they had another location over at City North (that place is still around?) before this one. I used to work at a restaurant in the Scottsdale Quarter before any other shops opened up, and if this place was here then, I would have definitely been spending a lot of money here!

I don't understand why someone would go to Starbucks, or Coffee Bean, or even Coffee Planation or Jolta Java (I support the local places but come ON, get some higher quality beans if you want me to come back!) when this place is so much better! It's a perfect place to grab a latte while you're shopping or if you need a little resting spot because your arms are sore from carrying those shopping bags full of new clothes. 

Bonus: They have a discount on baked goods after a certain time (like 3 or 4pm I think?). Great for an afternoon pick-me-up!,Some of the best espresso Ive had in a very long time! Was so impressed with the quality, the flavor and the staff, Press is a complete package! 

http://twitvid.com/KQMSN,Great coffee. Press is a part of my daily ritual. Large coffee every morning before walking into work.,Very cute little place in the middle of Scottsdale Quarter, especially like the foam art on the hot drinks!! I really think the extra small hint makes your day better :p 

Coffee(espresso) is to the bold side, always try to have a hazelnut latte for a new coffee place I try, so there goes for a bit of differences, lol... The place has a very simple decor with a few art pieces on the wall, sofas and chairs/tables are at choices. 

The only thing I'd ask more is a better menu maybe? The menu on the blackboard definitely isn't enough for a first-timer, you gotta ask what kind of syrup they have and other extra stuff, but I guess pretty much all coffee place have similar things? Just ask if you aren't sure...,Best damn latte I've had in ages!!,Delicious coffee, sort of like a local version of Starbucks. Strong flavors, but not too bitter, very smooth. I wish they served coffee in a mug for those of us sitting in.,I love this place! All the baristas I've met are passionate about coffee and really now what they're doing. They will actually take the time to do pour over coffee! Try the Chemex with a single origin coffee, you won't regret it.,Just wanted a small cup of coffee.  Maybe it was old but pH was low enough to etch metal.  The soy milk they added curdled upon impact.  I had one sip and tossed it immediately.  I won't go back.  Where can one get good coffee and not a blended drink?,Hey this place is small, nice, has friendly staff, and is hipster enough to feel unique, and not hipster enough so you don't feel like a tool for going.

I got the frape, thought it was european style frape, where they shake it up.Nope its their play on the starbucks frappacino. It is way better than the corporate version, Less sugar and actually tastes...good ... yeah i said it.

I'd go again if i was in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way to get some coffee here. Nothing knock your socks off awesome. Worth trying if you are in the area though.,After hanging out at Cartel all week I was skeptical how Press would compare.  Had a fantastic macchiato!  Baristas were very friendly.,The super cute barista with tats and blue eyes is way chill, in the southeast Portland sort-of-way!  It's refreshing to find some peeps who don't look like Kevin Federline and are genuinely friendly & helpful. 

The ambiance is a chill, post-modern meets restoration hardware esthetic.  Great flavored coffee roast & perfect break  around the corner from Apple & H&M, down from AX. DEFINITELY worth the walk across from Kierland Commons.,I've been a regular at Press Coffee for years for several reasons.  I love the atmosphere, very clean and bright in a warm way.  The only thing you really need to know about this place is that the staff and the owner is absolutely passionate about roasting and brewing coffee.

I've watched staff debate the absolute best way to brew a specific cup.  I've been asked to try a new brew method or grind and have yet to be disappointed.  I've talked with Steve ( one of the owners ) about his trip to South America to meet with coffee growers directly.  I've been impressed.

The true tell on how great Press Coffee is and why so many people love it is that I can drink their coffee black and it tastes amazing.  I've gone to so many places that pour asphalt into a cup, add corn syrup plus white color then call it coffee with a kick.  Its called not having to pay for good baristas because we serve corn syrup with caffeine.

So next time you're there try one of the cups black, I recommend the Amarro Gayo.  In between the rich earthy coffee flavor, you can actually taste the coffee's natural sweetness.  Press is one of the few places in town that has enough passion about coffee to be brave enough to serve coffee that way.

PS: Lea C. Give it some time, after sucking down high fructose tar at Starbucks you tend to forget what good coffee can taste like.  Once your taste buds come out of hiding good coffee will come back to you.,Yes, I've been drinking coffee since I was 16, yes, I'm addicted to coffee, no, I am in no way a coffee snob that can recite all the coffee barista lingo, but oh my goodness, Press = so delicious! I just got a latte, but received perfection topped  with a rosetta leaf latte art. No added, milk, sugar, or spices needed here folks! The staff was very friendly bringing me to the conclusion that I need to visit Press whenever I'm at Scottsdale Quarter. I'd give it 5 stars, but I'd like to try more drinks :),Honestly one of the best lattes I've had.  What great people that really care about doing things right.,Good coffee, not as good as Starbucks, in my opinion, and certainly nowhere near Ibis coffee. But the staff is friendly and it's a great place to work on my novels and people watch.,Every bit as good as their City North store. The Chai is fabulous and their Ethiopian coffee is off the charts too. Finally there is GOOD coffee in that part of town.,Well to begin with, I find their City North location to be a lot more inviting and colorful. The Scottsdale location is really depressing to look at and truly lack personality. Other than the charming barista, there is nothing about this coffee house that I find warm. In fact, I feel the exact opposite about it. I don't like the vibe, cause it does not have any.

The latte was nothing to rave about...Okay, a little latte art but the espresso really lacked body.

The croissant was an absolute disaster and tasted more like a neglected piece of dough....all that for two dollars. Really guys, you need to have to kick ass pastries for your coffee shop...have some delivered by MJ Bread, figure out a way to make them yourself and taste good...even Olive and Ivy makes better croissants than you do.

I really wanted to write a positive review, but really I am disappointed.,Great place for a pick-me-up when you're out shopping. It's great that they aren't limited to just coffee as well - they have 4 or so flavors of smoothies available. Prices are reasonable and a comfortable atmosphere.,I'm not a major fan of their coffee right now -- I'm going through my obsession with The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf at the moment --- BUT they are a delicious alternative to multi-national chains and you can show your support for local, eco-friendly businesses. This is a true coffee shop. 

The shop itself is kind of small and narrow but you can't go wrong with Scottsdale Quarter.

Their hot chocolate is yummy. 

Oh, their logo is awesome.,Dear Press,

If you ever want to see your precious four stars, add almond milk to the inventory! I ain't even mad about the lack of bathroom. All I want is milk that isn't sweet and watery (rice milk), GMO'd and packing weirdy aftertaste (soy milk), or brimming with lactose.

The rice milk chai was pretty tasty (but be warned: 99% sweet, 1% spicy), and the butterscotch loose leaf tea was quite good, as well. Both would have been significantly better with almond milk, though, and the barista even said that that's all he uses at home.

See? There are more of us out there - the few, the proud, the nutty. All I'm really saying is this: cater to our needs. We have cash.,some of the best latte and the best ice coffee i've had in the country!  really not much different in price than cbtl or starbucks, yet can't even compare the quality.  

if you want to be able to park right outside the cafe, try going to their citynorth location.  parking can be a pain at scottsdale quarters unless you don't mind parking in their garage and then spend 10min walking over.,This is a cute little coffee shop. Met here to do some business earlier today and it was perfect - just quiet enough to have a good conversation and close proximity to the parking garage - getting in and out was a breeze.,I went today for the second time. I love how friendly the employees are! I also love that they carry rice milk! Anywhere else the dairy free options are typically soy.  Must try is the blended chai with rice milk. SO GOOD!,Each time I visit Scottsdale Quarter, I discover a new treat to hit the streets. While preparing for an event today, I found myself in need of a caffeine boost and hoped for a coffee shop in the Scottsdale Quarter. Wish and your dreams come true...or apparently that's the case in this situation! Enter Press Coffee. 

Situated off one of the alleys in the Scottsdale Quarter, this is a must-try for the caffeine crazed folks like me. The coffee shop isn't huge, but it's big enough to comfortably seat a couple high top tables, as well some other seating in addition to the outdoor tables surrounding the front. I walked in to be welcomed by two visitors enjoying a game of chess, a woman working on her computer and guests with their dogs out front. It looked like a comfortable setting to do some work or relax. 

The staff greeted me and I decided to go for an iced coffee with a splash of chocolate, sugar free vanilla and non-fat milk. I got a 16 oz (yes it was one of those days) and was pleasantly surprised at the $2 price tag. This is not what I expected at a coffee shop within the Scottsdale Quarter. 

The coffee was delicious! Now, normally, iced coffees pretty much all taste the same. However, the actual coffee in this iced coffee tasted different...in a good way! The iced coffee went down smoothly and almost tasted like a dessert treat. It gave me the energized kick I needed. 

If parking wasn't such a problem at Scottsdale Quarter, I would plan on visiting often, but I'll have to opt for only times when I have the time to find a parking spot and make it a leisurely trip.,They roast their own beans, so the espresso has amazing flavor!  It is impossible to go back to Starbucks after having coffee from Press on a regular basis!,Small shop.  Tastefully decorated.  Excellent coffee.,Yeah....tried this place on a whim as we were walking by and I needed some coffee for the house; and an afternoon caffiene jolt. The place was very clean and neat, but....if you in any way shape or form like a strong coffee with solid flavor DO NOT go here!

This coffee is weak and watery both fresh from the storefront and when made at home. Even with a turkish grind and extra coffee added to the machine in an attempt to achieve flavor and a kick.

All in all I do not understand these great reviews; in my opinion if you are looking for a watery beverage with little flavor and maybe a hint of caffiene go here.

Otherwise skip it.,They have great coffee and expresso.  It's very urban and trendy inside with the good ""cool"" coffee shop feel.   

Try:
- Mochas ( Iced or Hot )",0.326744
One Coffee Co,"The BF and I went here the other day while we were riding our bikes around for exercise (yes...I know they kind of cancel each other out....oh well). We each had a latte and shared a blueberry scone. The coffee was good, it had a lot of flavor and the barista clearly knew what she was doing, but the real gem was the scone. This was a PERFECT scone! It was dry (like it should be) and had the right sweetness level. Only complaint...no bike rack! Oh well, we locked 'em up to the fence. We will definitely be back, especially because this place is so close to home.,Great spot in Downtown Phx! I got there almost by accident, tried the Chai-espresso and its delicious! The staff was really nice, the place has a good vibe, free and open wi-fi, great location.... I love it! 
I don't like that they close at 4pm on Fridays and at 1pm on Sat... They should close everyday at 8pm and even on Sundays it should be open.,Just had coffee (espresso). I have been there about 6 times now. Friendly, helpful staff. Their expresso is much better that most. I don't order by name as some places do similar drinks differently. I order by description. My drink is 2 shots of expresso in a tall cup not the short one. With one inch of foam. Call it what you want. I call it two shots of expresso in a tall cup with an inch of foam. If the espresso is good you don't need the foam. Theirs is good enough to drink with out the foam. I have found only 4 places that I can drink without the foam. 

Give them a try if you are downtown. They will treat you right and you will get the drink you ordered. 

ENJOY,Hooked on their coffee, both hot and iced.  The people that work there are super friendly and the pastries are good and varied, this place is fantastic.,Came for a conference and had breakfast here everyday! Great cappuccinos, scones and bagels. The yogurt and fruit was good too - just plain, thick yogurt - which is what I prefer. 
Free wifi too.,Whenever the fellow jurors plan to grab coffee (Starbucks is at the bottom level of the court house), I get all sweet and doe eyed and uppity state ""oh no, let's support a local biz instead!"" and we've bounced around a few coffee places since.

I get girly caramel or mocha nonfat lattes, and they are good.  I THINK the pricing is better than Starbucks (after all, how would I know? :D), plus the Yelp checkin deal is really nice if this trial goes WAY TOO LONG (Day 6 so far).

I would of thought this place was a corporate empire, if it was not for the Yelp reviews.  Each time I have noticed the greeting and smiling owner, doing his thing.

Just across the street north of CityScape, if a juror is trying to calculate how much time do they have...,As one who is always in desperate need of coffee I am happy with this new addition downtown. I 've been here twice and the service has been  great and the coffee fits the bill. I particularly like the atmosphere here. Especially in the summer when it's hot as hell, I walk into One Coffee and I feel like I'm in a coffee joint in a bigger city like San Francisco or Chicago. The windows facing Central Ave give the place an open, airy feeling which would make me maybe want to hang out and enjoy my brew if I had time.
In adddition to coffee they offer the requisite cookies and pastries. They also offer sparkling water, yogurt and oatmeal which is a refreshing difference. 
Also, they have a punch card which I REALLY like. It shows that these guys value their customers.,The coffee isn't as strong as I like, but it definitly is  smooth and non-acidic for those with coffee issues. The cafe itself is a very hipster sort of place, but I did like it. Very artsy inside (though, if you enter with childeren beware that you may need to do some censuring as some of the paintings may be a little crude....)

I'm still a bigger fan of Cartel or Lux. But, it was a nice sort of change of scenery. :),Right around the corner from Renaissance Hotel. Excellent coffee and tasty bagels and pastries. Other food (breakfast sandwich, paninis), but didn't try. Attractive decor that invites hanging around.,Staff members are awesome. Never had a drink I didn't like. I come here every day. Gonna miss it when I move.,I've come to the conclusion that this is the best coffee shop downtown and arguably in Phoenix. Granted lux is stellar, but I feel like I'm going to the mall when i go there... To many hipsters.,Espresso: Really good
Food: Scones looked good.
Vibe: Downtown busy
WiFi: yes
Plugs: ?.
Soy Out?: No.
Score: Yelp Check in Discount, and the owner (i think) is super hot and nice.,Love it! Their coffee is always perfect, the girls that work there are quick and sweet, their food is fresh, and the prices are way cheaper than Starbucks.,some of the best costumer service and best coffee ive ever had. I dont even like coffee well i didnt but now i cant get enough very cool vibe to chill and relax will make this place a daily stop.  a must go in downtown !!!!!!!,One Coffee Co was ridiculously close to my hotel in downtown Phoenix. The place was very quiet and contemporary. The woman at the register was sweet and easy to talk to. Originally, I was going to order a regular drip coffee, but my eyes wandered over to their specials board and saw ""Mexican Mocha."" I asked the barista about it, and she informed me that it was a mocha with a warm, spicy twist.

Sure enough, the taste of the mocha was quite shocking. I've had Mexican mochas in the past, but nothing like this one. Spicy upon first sip, I couldn't decide how I felt about it. But after the first sip, with the spicy warmth stuck in my throat, the next sequential sips were no longer surprising. The spice was meant to warm the drinker on a cold morning, while still being a pleasant beverage.

If given the opportunity, I would surely return to this wonderful coffee establishment!,Great family owned coffee spot.  I work in the building so I visit regularly.  The owner is usually there running around making drinks or making fun.  Him and the staff dressed up on Halloween and I thought it was great.  I appreciate that the staff recognizes regular patrons and they know my drink before I order.  Sometimes I bring my laptop and work in the coffee shop.  The music selections are always perfect for work/study.  They also have a stamp card that rewards regular customers with a free drink.  Starbucks who???,They keep adding new menu items, and each one is great.  This is a nice little coffee shop with very friendly staff members.  The coffee isn't as acidic as Starbucks', which is good for my taste buds, and the owner roasts the beans locally.  They have paninis that are tasty as well as a selection of pastries.   They also sell Mexican Coke (the soda, that is), if that tickles your fancy.  Free wi-fi makes it a nice place for a break from your work day.  Ask the owner to honk the horn on his electric bike that is parked inside.,As a Downtowner, I'm attracted to businesses that offer experience and community as well as a good cup of coffee. City Central delivers on all three. 
Damian, Danielle and the rest of the C3 crew bust their humps to make sure that every customer feels special and part of their java family. Their efforts have certainly paid off quickly, building an army of loyalists in just two short months.
In addition to the standard menu of hot, cold and blended coffee drinks, City Central offers teas, sodas, pastries and a very  nice selection of grilled panini sandwiches. Damian has been a coffee pioneer in Downtown Phoenix since the mid-90s and his expertise is obvious.
The atmosphere is superb. Free Wi-Fi, a nice selection of Pandora music playing throughout the tastefully decorated flat, newspapers and magazines for leisure reading, comfy seating, and a nice patio overlooking bustling Central Avenue.
So next time you feel a gravitational pull toward the Evil Empire (cough, Starbucks), instead head over to Central Avenue and Washington for locally roasted coffee served by an on-site local proprietor who actually cares about his patrons.,Local owned coffee place where the coffee is excellent and the food is delicious. The cookies are a thing to behold and you wont be disappointed. You also can't miss with the paninis. K enjoys the delicious non-coffee options such as the lemonade which is freshly squeezed and excellent. I believe everything is made from scratch or close to home: from roasting of the coffee to the homemade whipped cream. Chances are the owner is the guy making your coffee which is a pleasant change from ordinary places. The staff are genuine and just very nice. There is definitely a reason why I am there every day.,Super cute interior and very friendly staff. Brandi made me the most delicious chai tea. Lots of cinnamon.,Love going here for coffee and a great panini sandwich! Damian, the owner, is so friendly and fun to joke with when he's around. The other staff is friendly as well. 

There's a great vibe here. His brews are named after his daughters which is super cute. Depending on the time of day you have a mix of business professionals and students from the nearby Phoenix School of Law. I love the giant stenciled tree on the wall of the lounge inside.,Coffee Caramel Latte was good, the service by the girl at the register was just plain awful!!! The girl seemed annoyed, specially when I mentioned the 10% discount with  my checking with Yelp. 
She couldn't believe it, so I showed her my phone and she said she didn't know what Yelp was. 
*** That was insanely dumb, as she had a small sticker posted right next to the registered that read check us out on Yelp. GOSH!!!!! 
Bad day perhaps???  .
Oh well, I still decided to give this place three, tres, trois, tre stars for its awesome vibe, like the wall art and its sneaky location.
 Other than the bad service that day, it seems like a pretty legit coffee spot for those close to it. 

*** Might never come back honestly :),Great location and very friendly baristas. Pretty standard selection; the cappuccino I ordered did not change my life but was tasty.,One Coffee Co has officially become my new favorite coffee spot.  There are a lot of places to get coffee downtown and while each one has their high point, One Coffee Co. wins out on most of the categories important to me!

The atmosphere is cool, comfortable, and inviting.  Not like other super-hip and trendy ""you're lucky we let you in here"" places.  Couches to lounge in or a big 'community' table to enjoy your food and drink, and a bar to watch them work their magic.  Oh, and there is great music playing, I always know I'm going to walk out with a good song stuck in my head.  How often does that happen?!  

The staff is laid-back and friendly and always ready with a yummy drink suggestion when you're just not sure what you're in the mood for.  That's how I found my new addiction, the almond milk latte!  An amazing list of delicious drinks on the wall behind the counter.  And speaking of the counter, they use the square wallet app which is always convenient.

Breakfast and lunch options.  My favorites for breakfast are the quiche, the ""early-riser"" (bagel and egg sandwich), or a cup of oatmeal - THEY'LL EVEN STEAM THE MILK FOR YOU so it's nice and creamy and you get a little protein with the oats!

The pastries are delicious when I want to treat myself.  The one that I can't say, and won't even try an spell, has a little fruit and ricotta baked inside to make it perfectly creamy with just a hint of fruit flavor.  And, it isn't too big so I don't feel like I broke the calorie bank by 8 am.

I could go on, but instead, I'll highly recommend that you go check it out for yourself!  If you're looking for a caffeine fix, some good food, and a cool, cozy atmosphere, you won't be sorry!,A great alternative to the punks over at Cartel Coffee. At One Coffee they don't pretend to know what is best for you and they will make your coffee to order (how original!). The place forgoes the ""look how trendy ass kissin' this place looks"" and instead go for familiarity and comfort. 

It's actually very Starbuck-esque inside. 

The coffee itself is smooth as a baby's ass ... not in the least bitter or tart.",0.371131
Matador Coffee Roasting,"Yeah, these guys know their coffee! Tucked away in this little obscure strip mall about a stone's throw from my house. I had avoided going there because they used to put this mannequin matador out in front of their place. It was sun damaged, kinda creepy and just BAD in so many ways. I know, I shouldn't be such a branding/marketing snob but it was just creepy, I'm serious!

That said, they have since removed said matador and we decided to give it a try. Yes, we should have gone way before!! Exceptional coffee and an awesome omelette later, I was completely kicking myself for not trying it sooner.,I by almost all my coffee for my drip machine (yes, my automatic drip coffee maker...get over yourself) from here.  Mainly because they are close by  They roast their own coffee and have some excellent roasts.  My favorite so far is the Peruvian.  But there are still so many to try.  Their roasts are constantly changing, which can be annoying when you find something you like and next time it's gone.  

The people here are super friendly (both employees and guests).  The crowd is mostly 20-somethings (PVCC is right across the street), but I've never felt ""the old man"" when I'm in here.  They are not as specialized as Cartel Coffee, but offer great coffee and comfortable environment and a very pleasant experience.,Absolutely love this place!  it's my Sunday morning caffeine stop on my way to work those overtime hours.  
I always go with a drip coffee with cream and I'm never disappointed.  

Plus, every size cup is the same price!  doesn't get much better!  

Local art on the walls and just a relaxed, funky vibe...I really hope to have a Sunday morning just to sit & relax for a while.,I buy the fresh today whole bean coffee every few weeks for home. only thing I would change is the opening hours. The place just doesn't open up early enough for me to get breakfast and get to work on time.,After moving where a Starbucks isn't in walking distance, we found Matador's Coffee that is close enough for a Sunday stroll. It's nice and cozy and had a lot of things to choose from for breakfast, brunch or lunch! I've been trying out different iced lattes and coffees and all have been great! The sandwiches are made after you order so nothing is just put in a microwave. The pasta salad is great, too!! My husband ordered it once and I ended up devouring it. Nice sized portions. Has both indoor and outdoor seating, which is great because I don't like to leave my little pooch at home!,Went here recently with a lady-friend.  I've been dying to take her here and our vacation gave us the opportunity.

She doesn't drink coffee and when she asked what the ""barista"" recommended that didn't have coffee in it he rudely said, ""Go to Starbucks down the street.""

Despite my natural instinct to choke him, I quietly ordered a coffee as to not start my  vacation badly.

My lady and I went outside to have our drinks.  The ""barista"" left is post and sat outside too, with his friends.  They went on to heckle and by heckle I mean shout loudly, at the ladies entering the tanning salon a few suites over.  They were shouting, ""CANCER!"", ""SUN IS FREE, STUPID!"" and such.  Hey, employee at Matador.  They know, they don't care.  Shut up.  I'm pretty sure that shouting at potential customers makes you the stupid one.

Oh, yeah.  The coffee was a shadow of what it was and the chai latte my girlfriend got was awful.

Never coming to this place again.

Man, I miss Mario and co.,I enjoy going to the Matador. The staff is really nice and fun to talk to and the coffee is great! In addition there is free wi-fi!

The only downside is their hours. I came there to do some homework last week and it looks like they are closing at 5pm which is a huge bummer! If they stayed open later that would be awesome!,First, it is great to see a local company  roasting their own beans on-site!  The smell is intoxicating.  This little family run, locally owned business puts out some really great coffee and some enticing coffee drinks.  They run great specials and if you friend them on Facebook you can learn about all types of little specials they run.  To top it all off, the owner's father bakes many of their muffins, breads and other treats.   

Ok, wait, it gets better. Matador opened up last night as a wine bar too!! A few of us attended to celebrate my Canadian friend's green card, finally!  But that's another story.  Matador is the perfect coffee&wine bar because it is cozy and personal. We had the sangria which was really great. Not -too-sweet, crisp, tasty and full of fruit!  

I looked over the wine menu and it looks like they really took their time in selecting some nice wines and some great beers to feature.  They have  a small appetizer type menu with dips and bruschetta.  We did not order food but in observing the other tables the food looked great.  

I will be back to sample some of the wines and an app or two and,  as always, I will be in for my fresh roasted coffee!,Matador is my go-to coffee shop when I'm anywhere near the area and I even go out of my way to buy their beans for brewing at home. When I buy beans there, I always get two pounds, one ground in the shop for making toddy at home and one whole bean for grinding right before I brew it in my Moccamaster.  I love the Peruvian brand the most, but also enjoy the Mocha Java and Guatemalan..but really, I'll take whatever they have in stock, it's all fantastic and fresh. They give you a free coffee with the purchase of beans, and I opt for their cold brew (which is the only slightly weak point for me- it could be stronger but that's prob just me because it's the same level everywhere I go). 

The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable about their coffee, which is a major plus for me. The one barista (and I feel terrible for blanking on her name right now) remembered me after I hadn't been in for almost a year (I was pregnant and to my horror I couldn't even stand the slightest whiff of coffee..not that I would have drank any but I couldn't even go into a cafe for an herbal tea without feeling nauseated!) She asked me specific details about conversations we had had months and months before-completely winning my loyalty to the shop that employs her!

I chose my eye doctor and chiropractor based on their proximity to Matador, that's how much I love this place!,Perfect Capp... Not too hot.. Not too dry... & I like alot of espresso... Done! Friendly service:-) IM a complete sucker for a great coffee bar.. since I fell in love with coffee in the capital of java.. Seattle..:-),This is a nice little find in the north valley. I moved from Arcadia in the last year and was sad to leave my favorite local coffee shops behind. But I will be coming back to this place. The espresso is pretty good. A rather unique taste. Sort of reminds me of Urban Bean but a little better. They also serve beer at night which I thought was a nice touch. IF you are in the area and need a pick me up, this is your place.,Awesome coffee! Great friendly Manager and staff! Indoor and outdoor seating with great delectable delights! Love the art paintings too!!!,This is great local coffee! I tried from Whole Foods, Casa Blend, and it was very fresh really delicious.  Much smoother than many other popular roasters in the Valley.,Stickin' it to the man one cup at a time! If you think Starbucks is the only place for coffee then try this out. You'll soon learn how corporate America has been abusing your taste-buds.

Come find out what happens when you set aside the Profit and Loss sheets, the same store growth over last year charts, and the general ledger and see what happens when you start to care about the beans, the people and the community.

They have lunch food and alcohol (wines and beer) too.,We still frequent the Matador when we get to that part of town, and they are STILL amazing. Sarah, I believe is the owner of the place, and she is always working hard, and always remembers us. Still love them, have never ever had a bad experience with any of the staff or any of our drinks or food. YUM!,I popped into Matador yesterday afternoon (a bit after lunch time) for a pick-me-up.  I just love this neighborhood gem.  There's a nice comfy vibe and the staff is welcoming and accommodating.  They patiently fielded my questions about available sugar-free syrup options and happily indulged my request for a combination of syrups for my iced latte.  It was fantastic!,They actually roast their own beans which is rare in Phoenix.  Good, flavorful coffee here and polite staff too.  Good parking for the location and they have plenty of seating after they made some interior changes.  Nice place.,Amazing place that supports local businesses.... fantastic coffee ++, great Happy Hour.... this place should be everyones local hang out....,I recommend you try Matador if your at 32st and Union Hills. I used to live very close to this little coffee shop. The owners used to roast their own coffee here but have moved that operation to a better location. Their coffees are really good. 

They have a liquor license for a full bar with a minimal essential stock of beer and luxury spirits. I order a breakfast egg sandwich which was delicious. The young gal that slaved for me was super cool. 

Paradise Valley Community College is right next door to the South, so this is a good study hall.,PROTIP: Compliment and be interested in my weird hair and you will get cool points. 

Super-friendly barista, small setting littered with ASU-West students cramming for.. something.

I'm not drinking coffee anymore so I don't jazz the little fetus in my belly, so I opted for a mint tea. The tea sachet is sewn and held in a cheesecloth kind of thing and it was really fantastic! I'll go back soon.,Good coffee good location, but not a place I'd want to hang out. It's not that inviting to me for some reason. That said, I do really enjoy their coffee!,Came in a few times and had the breakfast burrito. YUM!  Also got a chai latte... also very yummy.

Their wifi is free and very fast.  Employees are very friendly and personable.  They all seem like they love there job which makes the atmosphere more enjoyable.

I'm new in town and have found my new trusty coffee shop :),Drip coffee is pretty good, but of the several visits I have yet to get anything near a decent espresso drink. For example, the small americano has a single shot and then water. The extra large (Why is there an extra large?) has a single shot then water.,Underrated...this seems to be a theme for me lately.  These guys are solid.  I am doing all I can to support local business.  And not just any local business will cut it with me.  I will try you once but you better have your game face on and these guys do.  Quality Coffee and the Food is a lot better than you may think.  Especially for the price.  I got a huge Breakfast Burrito (on a real plate) for $3.50 what??  It is easy to just drive by and go to a Starbucks but we as a city need to go out and try local places.  It does a lot more for the community than you know.  And they are great so do it.    Life is short...stop and smell the coffee.  I just handed them their new t-shirt.
P.S. I am a Starbucks guy but am slowly changing my ways I will miss the drive-thru service.",0.27422
Mama Java's Coffee House,"Mama Java's is very cute.  We used to have work meetings in the back room (well, they company I work for still does but I don't work there anymore).  My favorite thing about Mama Java's is that they have MATTE!!!!!:),Been coming here for a long time.  Coffee is decent, can't speak to the froofy stuff, I stick to boring black.  Generally not too busy (unlike Lux), free wi-fi, great music, plenty of seating with a few not very appealing chairs on the sidewalk outside.  Never pretentious.  They always feature a variety of artists, and offer more local music and open mics than most places.  This place supports Phx artists, makes me happy to support them.,Was walking by and really wasn't in the mood for coffee.....but.....something won me over. Don't know if it was that I was just having a 'leisure day' or didn't want to go home and do household chores I've been putting off or the look of the place and that it wasn't busy at all. (I'm going with a combination of all four options with a HEAVY leaning towards not wanting to get home and do chores.) ;-)

So, in I walked and went for an iced mocha. Made quickly and professionally. I almost opted for a rugala....and now I wish I had since several reviews say they are great. Next time....

Like I said, it wasn't busy....nice and quiet....which is good for coffee time. For me, anyway. 

Liked the vibe of the place....a few small tables and chairs and a couch...(or two?). There is free wi-fi available.....cool, cool, cool. 

They seem to sometimes have live music which if I have a night off may go back for. And they have some breakfast options available too - breakfast sandwiches and omelettes. Nothing too fancy or extravagant but good to know if I'm up early and want breakfast. 

Will definitely go back and try it out again.,We wandered in here after walking back to the Zipp's parking lot for vehicle retrieval. I got a delicious peach iced tea that I didn't want to end. However, I just walked half a mile in 100 degree weather, so it had to.

They have adorable little treats for only $.60 each (or 3 for $1.50). The chocolate covered macaroon was by far the best. Much like the elusive ""Bon Bon"" I feel like I've heard a lot about Macaroons in my life, while never actually tasting one, so I'm glad that changed with Mama Java.

Also, they have a toy sushi set that I really enjoyed. It was among the books. Next to the Mr. Potato Head. I think it was for children, but I'm easily amused so I had a fun time with it.

The only thing I would change is the $.50 surcharge for credit card transactions. But their macaroons are only $.60. I could probably scrounge up that kinda coin from my car any given day, so I'm not too worried about it.,Mama Java's is the colorful, neighborhood coffee house. This is where we go for gourmet coffee & tea, chat, and simple breakfast fare. They also support the local music and arts scene by providing a venue for performances for both local and non-local acts, an informal art gallery, and a selection of periodical and other literature as well. Free wifi Net access complements the offerings. 

Make no mistake about it: MJ's caters to a different audience than Acacia Cafe (thet new kids down the block). Mama Java's is really a neighborhood focal point as well as a business. Here people get to know each other, and most are worth knowing.

Truthfully I'd givce it a 4 1/2 rather than a 5 because of the limited food selection, but then again that's not the point at Mama Java's.,I came here to use their WiFi. I had a chai latte which was fabulous. The staff was very friendly and the coffee shop was mostly quiet I got a lot of work done.,Decided to try this placed based on the reviews and the fact that its pretty close to my house.  
The vanilla latte is amazing...tastes great and leaves me feeling a tad ""buzzed"". Generally, I stop by on Sunday afternoons to chat it up with friends. Its busy, but not to the point where its difficult to find a place to sit.,I can't work at home because the bed always calls my name. So I needed a place to go where it would slightly uncomfortable to sleep at, offered free-wi-fi and possibly have cute boys I can pretend to not stare at. 

Mama Java's fulfilled one of my requirements: it was definitely not  a place I could nap at. There are lots of tables, not enough outlets for your laptop and only ONE couch that I wouldn't even think about having drunk sex on. To be fair, this is a coffee shop, not a whore house so ignore my last comment. 

What I meant was that it isn't a cozy place, rather cold, actually. I'm used to smaller coffee places where its warm from the steaming coffee cups, the closeness of people sitting around me and the many couches or arm chairs. I just need a hug at Mama Java's. 

There was only one guy at the counter when I was there and a long line but I don't have anything important to get to so I didn't mind the wait. I ordered a non-fat chai latte and it okay. Too sugary and strong spices.

I'm actually writing this review as I'm finishing up here at Mama Java's. It's getting cold and I have to go pee really bad, so I have to wrap up this review and head home, which is just down the street. I have a shy bladder.,I enjoy this place.  The barista's are always friendly, helpful, and smiling.  I've only ever had their Chai, hot and cold, so I can only speak to their Chai, but it's tasty.  The shop is large, comfy, and welcoming.  They have a large book wall, I'm not sure if it's a book-swap thinggy or not.  I did get annoyed when one of the baristas insisted on calling a ""Soy Chai"" a ""Choy"".. haha.  It just sounded retarded to me.  I, of course, wouldn't dock points for that, just wanted to throw it out there.  Whenever I'm in the area (which is surprisingly frequent) I stop by.,Was a great joint-
I usually go to fair trade coffee down town PHX, and I must say I enjoy here better after 1 trip.

The Lil orange hair lady was kind and my coffee was yum!

Macaroons, yes please!

Music that most can listen to was being played and some books were available.

Go here to relax and yea.. Go,I usually go to coffee shops to work and Mama Javas is a strong contender in my rotation.  They have free internet and a variety of comfortable seats inside and out.  The coffee is great but the snacks and food leave a bit to be desired.  

I enjoy the art they have on the walls which is rotated regularly.  They have regular live entertainment including open Mic Nights which draw quite a crowd.  Even when packed and loud I am still able to find comfort and quiet space to work in the back room.,I really enjoyed myself here!! I wish mamas was closer to me! The prices are around starbucks but, that's okay. I was spontaneous one day and wanted to find a great place to sit and work and I found Mama Javas! So awsome! Im not a ""hipster"" so I wasnt really feeling the atmosphere or did I feel like I fit in (they could work on that) But, I was there to work and enjoy coffee and I did. Bagel was amazing too!,I just moved down the street from this place and decided to give it a try the other day. I'm always in favor of supporting independant businesses over Four Bucks for the sake of morality, but they usually are not that much cheaper.

Not only was I thrilled to see some healthy items in the baked goods section, it's all homemade and doesn't look like it came from a factory. My iced coffee was amazing and the owner is such a nice guy!! Introduced himself and welcomed me to the neighborhood. 

A nice roomy place with wifi is always nice compared to the crowded-by-retail BS in Starbucks.,Cool place.  Has low key, hippie feel.  Strong Americano for sure!!!,Good coffee. Casual, comfortable ambiance and I had no trouble finding a plug. They have a ton of local products and really yummy bagels and pastries. I don't know that I would continue to go out of my way to go here, but it was definitely not too shabby!,Great food, great prices.

Not so friendly for computers; not a ton of outlets, and the internet was a little shaky upon the few times I used it.

However, they have delicious knishes and ruggulah, and this little Jewess has to give them mega points for that, as well as their $.25 refills on the daily iced tea, and their amazing photos/books of animals waiting to be adopted. Broke my heart a little, and I almost went home with a 4th fur kid, but I love coffee shops that are actively a part of the community.

My favorite barista Meschelle doesn't seem to work there anymore, but I love the atmosphere of chill during the day, the books to read, and the drink AND food menus.  Great local, indie owned coffee place. I do wish they had more than one iced tea option, especially since kiwi strawberry seems common, and I'm not so much a fan.,Just had my first experience here :) I just decided that I need to be studying outside of the house and this place is perfect for that! 
The girls working there are so nice, and cleaned up right after a giant group of people moved out. The music and atmosphere is very artistic (totally reminds me of my art high school!) and trendy. 
Its right up the street from my house, and there is never a shortage of parking in this huge complex. It was so nice to just sit and do my thang without feeling like I was just taking up space.
I will for sure be here twice a week every week from now on :D,It takes forever for them to make a coffee. I have never been overly impressed, and wish that they would offer some gluten-free goodies! I heard that the Terrabite Bakery offers some GF goodies there, but I've never seen it. Although it's a cool atmosphere, I'm not sure I'm impressed enough to go back.,Great hideaway spot to work on the laptop an enjoy a coffee. Good value and made well  Quiche slice is very tasty but small for $4.  They have a lot of good choices.  The coffee was well made.  There is good seating.  

I like it here and it's remained good over the years. I stopped by after a night at Beckett's Table nearby to have coffee, but was surprised to see that they were closed so early in the evening.,I got a chai - it was weak and not flavorful at all.  Other than one corner w/a couch and two leather chairs it is NOT a relaxing atmosphere either, lots of hard kitchen style chairs at small tables.  Not a lot of ambiance.,What a delightful little treat! I have wanted to check this place out since I learned about it last summer and finally went. I got there late, so they were closing up shop, but I still had a great experience. My coffee shop benchmark is espresso. If a coffee shop can't get espresso right, then there is no hope that it can get anything else right. But Mama Java's gets espresso right! With just a splash of milk it tantalized my espresso loving taste buds with its smooth, sweet flavor. Like a good coffee shop there was lots of books, art, things to eat, places to sit, etc. This is a place I could spend hours on my laptop or a place to sit and talk philosophy.,I will start with the disclaimer that I love independent coffee shops. I'm not a Starbucks girl. So I think I wanted to like Mama Java's better than I actually did. 
My co-worker and I headed there one afternoon to do a little work. We walked in and there was nobody there (but it was the middle of the afternoon on a weekday). The barista must have been hard of hearing because even though it was pretty quiet in there we had to repeat our orders several times. But he got them right eventually so I guess that's what really matters.
We sat down at a little table near the window and over time the place did start to fill up. But there was just something about the vibe in there that I wasn't feeling that day. I can't put my finger on it but it just wasn't the comfy coffeehouse feeling I'm used to at other places. Maybe it was just what I was working on.

I would go back but I wouldn't rush back. Sorry!,Officially the roo--gaah--laa is very tasty in all 3 flavors.  Chocolate, raspberry and apple cinnamon.  K.,I love Mama Java's. They have free WiFi, every Sunday night they have a Bluegrass jam session and their coffee drinks, chais and teas are excellent. 

But, what makes me adore them is what I experienced during one visit. The night before, I had put my debit card, cash and ID in my pocket to go to a show, and forgot to transfer them back to my wallet.  I didn't realize this until I had placed and received my order. The woman behind the counter said ""don't worry about it, you win some and you lose some"" and then the woman behind me offered to pay for my drink. I dug into my wallet and gave them all of the change I had, which probably amounted to 32 cents. You gotta love a place where everyone is invested in making sure you get your caffeine fix.,I have loved this place for a long time.  It troubles me that people write such negative things in their reviews.  Hi, it costs money to have a credit card machine and if you don't spend over five bucks it costs the COMPANY money. Duh.   And in regards to closing early, yes, it is a bummer.  However, it would be a far greater bummer if they had to close down instead.  In an economy where businesses are disappearing left and right, they are still here.  That says a lot.

The coffee is delicious, latte art very cool and the new baked goods made in-house are absolutely to die for.  Keep up the great work guys!,Love this place!  They're so friendly and the coffee is fantastic.  I'm a sucker for Starbucks because of the drive thru... but the more I visit Mama Java's the more I remember just how bad Starbucks really is.  If you haven't visited this place yet, do it!,Mama Java's feels like it belongs in a small college town. The three times I've been here the clientele has been younger, relaxed, and friendly. As are the employees.

The only reason I'm not giving Mama Java's five stars is because the only thing I've tried is their house coffee, which is very good. 

This is one of the coffee houses in central Phoenix where I can be pretty confident of finding an empty seat next to an electrical outlet to take advantage of their free wireless. Although they do have live music that at times fills the front of the house, there is a separate area in the back with bar-style seating and seating for about a dozen. There's a pretty good chance I can get some work done at Mama Java's anytime.,Acacia Cafe is, apparently, closed on Sundays. Luckily, Mama Java's is in the same complex so I took my friend to it due to remembering the reviews were positive. The cafe is warm and inviting and we went straight to the eggs speciasl-better luck before 2pm on weekends, folks. The display case had danishes, muffins, bagels and an odd exhibit of bowls with raisin bran already poured into  just ready for milk, I suppose? I went for the potato knish, which was way over priced at 3.25 and since a sign on the sandwich board said ""For 50 cents add tomato or cucumber to your bagel...or whatever"", I added what were light pink unappealing tomato slices. I ordered a Cafe Mocha soy...and he charged me 50 cents for the soy (ERRRRRR). I wanted at least a fruit cup but there was only a bowl of some bananas, an apple and an orange for the fruit options. My total was like almost 8 bucks-I could have had a full breakfast and coffee at Wildflower Bakery for that amount! The cafe person warned me my knish may be too ""peppery"". My friend was so hungry she got the ham and cheese sandwich...made with american cheese. No fruit, chips, whatever and a coffee. We sat by the window and perused the lackluster books for browsing (1989 travel guides to Portugal, anyone?) although we did end up on the sofa laughing at Garfield books someone had left. 

The prices and quality of food were absurd and I hate being charged 50 cents for soy milk aka the lactose intolerance tax. And since most people are quiet doing work, I felt strange shootin' the shit like we may be annoying people. I don't think I will be back anytime soon.,This little coffee house is great. I didn't actually have a coffee, but I definitely enjoyed the pastries they had. There were three different kinds: chocolate dipped coconut macaroon, raspberry and chocolate rugulah. The macaroon was amazing, especially with a tall glass of ice cold milk. I also enjoyed the art that decorated the walls... pretty cool place.,The pastries are SO good here.  The vibe is comfy.   Did I mention the pastries?  SO good.,Don't be fooled -- Mama Java's isn't a coffeeshop; it's actually a secret portal into Eugene, Oregon. Yes, really, right in that funky strip mall on Indian School, next to the Tuesday Morning. 

They have it all: hipster baristas, art on the walls, laid-back, slightly funky vibe. They even have the requisite kooky, befuddled, aging hippie behind the counter. He can't quite remember your order, but it's OK, because he's probably going to make you something delicious anyway, and he won't be a dick when you tell him it's the wrong thing.

They've also got that special brand of uppity-ness that you only find in coffeeshops -- you know, the kind that leads the baristas to post handwritten signs forbidding you from using your cell at the counter. Again, it's OK. After all, if you're on the phone while order, you are, in fact, a total fucking douche. 

The coffee's pretty tasty and the beans seem fresh, and they have a great setup for studying or working -- even tables in a little back nook that are perfect for groups. Free wifi, of course, and what looked to be a tasty small menu. 

Now if only they could transplant some evergreens to block out Indian School Road...then it really would be like Oregon.,i discovered this coffee joint after i got a new job in the neighborhood and my addiction to caffeine forced me to start looking around. from the outside, it doesn't look like much, a couple of plain patio chairs and tables, but once you walk in, you'll know this is going to be a regular stop on your way to go anywhere. very nice atmosphere, revolving art pieces over every wall, and my favorite, and actual espresso machine! (unlike the push button machines i find at every starbucks.) the staff is always awesome, and the clientele is very diverse. anyone from the suit and tie on the way to the office, to the hippie getting his morning started, everyones there and seems to be enjoying themselves.  i have to admit i haven't had any of their food yet, and im a creature of habit, so i found a few drinks that i like, and have stuck with them. but their iced coffee is hands down the best ive ever had. its strong but without any acidity. just smooth good tasting coffee. also, their pomegranate green iced tea is so good i didn't drink anything else for months. so if your looking for an alternative to starbucks that has a great atmosphere and even better coffee, give this place a try.,Pretty sweet little spot with nice and bitter espresso and quality artwork on the walls.  Doesn't 'try too hard' to be a hipster joint or to differentiate itself, instead seeming to pride itself on an innate classic-ness.

It seems ridiculous to use such words describing a coffee shop, but coffee seems to have a life of its own when it comes to creating its own subculture, similar to wine.,This place is right down the street from my house. It's close and in a great location (small shopping mall with a Zipps).

I really, really want to like this place, but for some reason the Barista's cannot get my order right! I do not like 3 pumps of any flavor in my latte, it's frankly too much flavor. Especially vanilla, it is already strong on it's own. Not sure why all these places claim to have the best coffee and espresso yet mask if with all the sugary flavors! All I ask for is a one pump vanilla latte, that's it! By the time I get to my car to take my first sip, it's ALWAYS WRONG. Guess I should drink it at the table to make sure it's right. I even see the barista write it down on the cup. Hmm not sure the disconnect here.

If you are looking for free wifi and a decent selection, check this place out. Just make sure you bring enough $$ so they don't charge the ridiculous .50 charge for using a card!,Mama Java...often the highlight of my day! 

Ok, so i might be a bit of a caffeine addict and while i am sure that contributes to feeling good almost every time i walk in the door at Mama Java, it is also the coffee and the staff that make me smile.  Best coffee, truly!  Jensy and Billie (the baristas) are sweet, fun, friendly and truly coffee prodigies.  I am sure they will have their very own coffee shop someday soon but for now I am happy to give them my $4.06 everyday like clockwork!!,Was working around the corner and saw this shack at the last minute.

I had to rush out of the house today with no coffee and no Wheaties. It wasn't going to be a hectic day thankfully, but having a giant latte and a bird seed bagel with cream cheese sure would hit the spot.

Thank you my friends!,I've been in a few times but only to grab something and go. On Friday, I spent the entire afternoon there drinking a perfect Chai and studying. I was astonished at how perfect the atmosphere was for studying. I got a lot done. I enjoyed the music. I think I'll be back soon.,I have been going to Mama Javas with my daughter  since she was was 9 months old. I love this place. Seriously!
 The coffee is awesome, the location is as well. And the big table in the back room is perfect for spreading out a bunch of light plots to review. 
 I just stopped by earlier last week and saw they had re done the back room a bit, and it had a much better layout.
 The food is good, especially the potato knish. I wish they had an actual kitchen, but since they are a coffee shop and not a restaurant, I can give them a pass.
 And the live music is great as well, really I wish we had more places like this, but then again, I guess that you shouldn't mess with perfection.,Okay, so I actually like Mama Java's coffee, expect for they looked at me crazy the other day when we asked for cream. Last I checked Cream and Sugar are the coffee standards. Anyway, my problems lies in what has happened in the coffee world. I know there is the big debate between Sbux and smaller privately owned coffee shops. I am the first to admit that yes I prefer the smaller shops. Here is my problem.... 

Products take on the name as the product, i.e Band-aid, Levis, Q-tip, Duck Tape, ect. I think it is VERY rude to correct a customer when you know what they mean. This happened to me - I should have stated Medium however I forgot and said Grande - OMG shoot me now, the look of disgust and the correction. I wanted to take my $4 back and go to Sbux, at least they don't correct you and the customer is always right 

This become more evident when I was at Tuesday morning with a friend and I told her we should grab some coffee, but I actually had to tell her before we went in to not say Grande. She laughed her light hearted self and rolled with it. Really though, I have to tell a friend make sure you order correctly. 

Anyway, the last straw was yesterday when my boyfriend asked for cream in his ice coffee and they stared at him like it was crazy. I get wanting to be a liberal elitist, I think of my self as one sometimes. You just can't forget the customer is the business. If you know what they mean roll with it - DONT correct them. For $4 a cup of fancy coffee, I'll go to Crate and Barrell and buy a cappuccino maker and make my own. Yes Mama Java - this liberal elitist knows how to make her own.,We go to Mama Java's on a pretty regular basis. We have always enjoyed stopping in. The baristas are fantastic, especially Jency, she's our favorite. 

This is a great locally owned coffee house where you can go and relax and chit chat with friends or get some work done while using their free wi-fi.

A must for anyone that lives or works in the neighborhood!,Quick update for Mama Java's since we had the Yelp Office Hours there last week... we lucked out and were able to take over the couch / chairs to the right when you walk in the door.  It worked out perfectly!  

Even though I hadn't been in to MJ in a couple of months, Jensy remembered that I drank a soy latte - incredible!  I felt so special (almost like a regular) when I walked in and she greeted me and asked if I wanted a soy latte!  I did, and it was just as good as last time!

The atmosphere provided the perfect place for the yelpers to come and go, chat, etc... I think everyone felt comfortable and welcome.  Thanks again to all of you who came by to visit!  Looking forward to the next time... 

Lastly, MJ created a yelper special of the day... the ""hold me closer tiny yelper' which i believe was a vanilla cinnamon latte.  Now if that didn't make us feel special, what does?!,We went here for some live music a few weeks ago.  It was nice to see other people in there.   My order did get mixed up (latte instead of a chai latte), but I won't hold it against them :)  (I drank it anyway).,An independent coffee house is Phoenix?  Really?  Yep.  The coffee is okay, but I wouldn't come here for the coffee.  Come here to read a book, people watch, listen to some music, be social.,PROS: Coffee quality, espresso quality, Barista skill, Barista friendliness, espresso drink menu is outstanding in terms of options and clever twists, and Layout/design is SUPERBLY inviting and cozy, and its perfectly lit, mostly taking advantage of natural light.  Pleasing mix of live entertainment.  Free Wifi, and 80% of the patrons seem to be using it at any given time for hours on end (coffee shop commuter office).

Middle of the Road:  nothing, really, the elements of this place are either very good (see above) or rather bad (see below). 

CONS:  Those damned debit card charges are kind of annoying.  Staff can get overwhelmed at peak times.  Breakfast stuff is fair to slightly-above-average quality, but surprisingly limited for such a popular place.  Location is humble (but convenient), smashed between a scary looking bar and a weird hardware-type retailer.

Probably my third favorite local coffee shop in the valley behind 32 Shea and Coffee Roastery on Hayden (and I've tried dozens and dozens of them), and I definitely beat a path to Mama Java's whenever I'm in the area.,Showed up at 7pm on a Saturday night. We could see a guy with a guitar singing inside... one of my personal harbingers of doom. After I walked in, though, I was pretty relieved to hear the guy wasn't bad and the volume wasn't deafening. But the place was packed. So we sat outside with our drinks, trying to ignore the thumping music and screaming from the bars nearby, until some guy lit up a cigarette right next to us and we had to migrate inside. Yeah, I'm one of 'those' nonsmokers. 

Then the weird vibes started. We parked at a recently vacated table and commenced reading/studying. I looked up and realized we were the only ones in there that didn't appear to be there for the musician, and everyone else in the place was completely silent. My fiance quietly murmured a few words to me at some point and it seemed like half the room turned around and glared at us. Cozy! Uh, this is a coffeeshop... right?

The hot chocolate was good, I want to go back and try their steamers. I also like that they serve food. But when I go back I think I'll check their calendar to make sure I'm not showing up during live music...,My gal and I decided to give Mama Java's a try and I realize why I love Hava Java so much. 

Mama Java does have good coffee! If you want a good cup of Joe this could be your place. I guess I have been spoiled by HJ's service. 

Mama Java's seems to have a more sterile and less friendly feel to it. It could have just been the time we went, but I had no desire to stay and drink our coffee. The place wasn't as welcoming as our usual hangouts.

Overall the coffee was worth 4 stars, unfortunately the service and atmosphere brought it down a little for me.,I'm going with Gabi on this one (kiss ass that I am) and raising it one star. I'm all about customer service. And the ladies serving up the joe at yelp office hours were perky and aromatic. Just like the coffee! Just remember. No cell phone at the counter....we don't want Mama Dearest Java Coffee House now do we!? ""NO CELL PHONES AT THE COUUUUNNNTTTER!!"",strongest coffee, pure organic milk and great atmosphere! I dream about the coffee!,Hot, yummy chai. A cozy, art-focused decor. Live musical acts and open mic nights. Plenty of reading material. Comfy couches, chairs and tables. Service with a smile. This place is great.,Update:  Hade their iced mocha today.  Not bad.  Not bad at all.  I would order it again.  AND NOW WE DANCE!,This is my spot. The more mature staff members are very cool; like European cafe barista meets Santa Monica cool-cat. Participating in the coffee of the day feature is always fun. I hold most of my professional meetings (since I can run my precious metals business virtually anywhere) here and also meet my friends and love here when we want to break up the day and touch base over some lovely java. Even the patrons here are way cool. The prices are alright and they support non-profits too, which I like a lot.,Meh...it was fine. Props for being an independent coffee shop, but Mama Java's is not quite my flavor. 

I am so not a fan of a super bright coffee shop. I like some nice dim lighting with comfy chairs and couches. They have mostly little bistro tables with wood chairs, not so comfy. Mama Java's is more a wall of windows and very bright light. I am not saying it is wrong, just not where I want to hang.

This place could probably be a nice place to hang out at with a makeover. Some drapes, more comfy chairs and sofas, a dimmer switch. Calling all designers, please do a makeover.

The espresso was decent, and I had a ham and cheese on a croissant that was basic but good. Although a little lettuce on the sandwich wouldn't have hurt. It really was just ham and cheese, good, but nothing to write home about.

The staff was super nice, but this place just needs some help if it's going to be a great coffee place to hang out at. Closing at 6PM daily does not help either.,Exceptionally comfy and attitude-free coffee place. Plenty of evening entertainment, free wi-fi, and the friendliest staff around. Definitely a neighborhood mecca for those of us in Arcadia or the Arcadia-ish area. Meet your neighbors or sit and chill -- free will is the essence of Mama Java.,This place was ok.  It has a real crunchy vibe.  The iced coffee is kind of bitter.  There are interesting people hanging out in there.  I kind of felt like I was intruding on the staff, their conversation seemed more important than serving.,Discovered this gem on a Friday afternoon. Great Latte. Cool Kick back down to earth staff. More comfortable vibe than any coffeehouse in Seattle I've been to. Great of them to have the Heather Hill Photo showing for Provety Pets going on when I stopped in. I was able to browse the photos and then order without feeling I had to. 

They could use a few more flavors for their coffee drinks though, I like butter rum and butterscotch if you;re reading. For the moment it;s not walking distance for me but I consider it a great neighborhood spot.,The short: It's all solidly good--the not-too-pricey coffee, the simple pastries, the breakfast sandwiches and knishes, the baristas, and the comfortable and mellow atmosphere when going solo or meeting a few friends. 

The long: Located on the southeast corner of Indian School and 36th St., in the strip mall between Tuesday Morning and Darwin's, MJ's is accessible and fairly easy to sign. The wall of windows lights the place up awesomely, and even at night, it doesn't turn into one of those dark, moody coffee joints. They find new artists to show art every couple of months or so, and it's usually pretty good. Their couple handfuls of small tables are easy to shift around if you're joining a group, but big groups might feel uncomfortable since it's not exactly huge. There's a nice quiet room around the back for people studying, but it's not enclosed, so on open mic nights or nights when there are featured performers, it's not so quiet. I love how clean they keep the place; when the baristas aren't working the counter, they're wiping down the windows, bussing tables, and restocking the coffee condiment bar. 

Speaking of the baristas, they're always friendly and attentive, good at showing off how to hustle (because when a coffee shop's busy, I feel better if baristas actually act like it), and totally interesting to look at--like fashion icons for today'",0.245793
Lux,"This place was not a favorite of mine.  I was hoping this was going to be a great coffee joint.  It looked promising.   There was a line, a long line,  which shows that Phoenix is desperate for a place like this.  They had a good selection of baked goods (quiche and pastries).  They have other items to order, but, according to the person taking our order, the menu changes and they did have one to look at.  She had to tell us what else there was to order.  This takes time and holds up the already long line.  If I was just stopping in and did not know to ask, I would not have ordered anything.  I ordered a mocha, the quiche and a scone.  They offered to heat up my quiche... mistake and I will get to that. 

The place to pay, pick up and fix up your coffee were in the same 5 or 6 foot square and with a line this long it got crowded quickly.  The other thing was that if you were not paying close attention you could miss you order.  They put the order out and call your name and that was it.  You then had to look over several drinks that look the same trying to sort out which is yours. 

My coffee came out quickly.  Then my scone a few minutes later... not sure why it took so long to get a baked good from a plate to the counter.  My quiche was warming and took much too long. I was with my wife's cousin and his made to order breakfast came out just as quick as my scone and the quiche was almost 10 minutes later, it was only luke warm.

The scone (lemon poppy seed) was a little bland.  The quiche was... well see above and was only so-so.  The coffee was fine, but nothing special.  They want you to bus your dishes, but don't label the place to put the dishes. 

They had a DJ for on a Friday morning was a bit much.  The music was also too loud for a morning coffee joint.  I should not have to tell a DJ to turn the music down at a coffee joint in the morning.  This was a place where people were working, reading and socializing... it is not a night club, even if it was jazz.

Another thing about the line... I actually saw several small groups leave after waiting too long.

The people who started Lux saw potential, but I don't think they know how to run a coffee shop.  Unfortunately this is the only true game in town and people are going to put up with this until someone opens the competition.,You have to try the velvet!!! Lux is so to die for, we actually had a meeting at my office that it is ok to go during work hours without counting it as a break as long as you bring some back for everyone. (no joke),I've been coming to Lux regularly now for about 2 years and generally really love the place! 

Coffee: Really pretty good. I'd been to some pretty good places back in CA, so have some pretty high standards regarding good coffee. I think Lux does a pretty decent job. The drip coffee and iced teas have free refills.

Food: A little pricey, but the food is always pretty good. Their macaroni and cheese is cheap, though, and awesome (5 bucks). You can get it with jalapeno and bacon (7 bucks). Sometimes, they even have pesto and chicken in it. They start serving dinner at 5:30. Their breakfast is always pretty good, too, and they always have a variety of different quiches.

Staff: All pretty nice and the more you come there, the more social they will be with you. If any even minor inconvenience arises, they're pretty good about spotting the charge, but it rarely happens that they have to do that. 

Environment: Yes, there are a ton of hipsters there, but that's kind of to be expected with good coffee shops in any city. There's a lot of people studying, but there are people meeting socially throughout the coffee shop, as well and especially near the bar area. Plenty of outlets exist for you to plug into. They have a projector in the backroom and there is usually some sort of sporting event playing on it. The only con is that the internet (especially lately) has been somewhat spotty as the place is usually pretty busy and everyone and their grandmothers are trying to connect.,As much as I love Lux, I'm kinda glad that it's not closer to my house, otherwise they might have all of my money. Working from home, I need to get out and set up shop elsewhere every once in a while so that I don't start talking to my houseplants, and more often than not, Lux is my destination.

The service at Lux is always friendly and often funny. And I've sat close enough to the register enough times to hear them being friendly to people of all ages, shapes and sizes. The coffee is rich, dark and delicious. I usually stick with a house coffee with soy milk, so I do ok price-wise. I even buy the whole beans to brew my own coffee at home. I like it that much.

Lux gets packed, but I've always been able to find a space and get access to an outlet for my power sucking laptop (not an apple, by the by). The music is good and mellow--think the Shins or the Stones. They've also got killer pastries, and if you time it right, you'll get them fresh out da oven.

Coffee shops are all kind of a personal preference thing. There are lots of good spots in Phoenix, but Lux is my favorite.,Lux is SO bi-polar. Half the time the music is unbearable- industrial and LOUD and the service is little more than a grunt from the guy taking your order and your money. The other half of the time the music is Jazz and very conducive to drinking coffee and talking and seemingly more appropriate for the environment. Every once in a while there will be a semi-friendly face at the register, but not very often, in fact it is rare- I once made the mistake of ordering a small drink and they snarled at me that they ""only pull double shots"" which I had read only moments earlier on the menu but had already forgotten (mommy brain) but they definitely could have handled that a little more nicely. They have books and other kid entertainment so I know they WANT to be kid friendly but the loud industrial music has got to go. The coffee is good and the environment is cool. The pastries are heavenly. I would have only given them 2 stars but the owners are pretty cool and I have hope that they will become more consistent with the music and service. I haven't been there in  a while, mainly for fear of a bad experience but I will give it another chance. I hope they become less focused on being ""cool"" and more focused on giving customers a genuinely well rounded- good experience.,First up, great coffee. It's a shame they have such tasty mochas, because here is a place you can get a solid cap or espresso without fear. Just too many decisions. Their homemade whipped cream is amazing, so I often open for the quad-shot con pana to light me up. It's fantastic.

Next up, friendly, smart staff. They always seem extra happy, which may be the constant buzz from the espresso and whipped cream rushes I am sure they cruise on all day.

Cap it off with tasty pastries, nice vibe and decor, and it is one of my favorite coffee shops in town.

The only downside at all is that it's popularity can make it crazy busy, so if you're looking to sit and relax or work for a bit, get there eeeeeeearly.,Very comfortable place. Tried the mocha velvet...i like it a lot. Although I enjoyed the selection of music I initially thought it was a little loud.  I got ""engrossed"" in the work I brought with me so got used to the music level rather quickly. The lady next to me was crunching on a toasted ciabatta which smelled heavenly. Ahhh...perfectly toasted bread. Definitely a simple pleasure worth savoring. 

Only wished this place was closer to my neck of the woods. Oh, and no outlets to plug in laptops.,What I like best about Lux is the excellent coffee and great music/DJ.  I used to enjoy the interesting and happy, laid back crowd of people that tended to flock to Lux to sip a coffee while working on their laptops or chatting for a while over a dessert. 

 For some reason- is it the larger meals?  the alcohol?  the bigger more comfortable seats?  the typewriters?  the extra bathroom?- the new Lux draws a totally different demographic... mostly over 40 and under 5.  Think yoga pants or church dresses... with a bunch of poorly behaved kids yelling ""Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom.... DAD!"", running, and twirling around in a crowded space with adults carrying full-to-the brim coffee cups.  Or worse, the screaming infants of hipster (or used to be) parents who can't let go... they honestly think they can remain cool by sitting on the couch sipping Velvets while the entire place is subjected to their bawling infants whom they expect everyone to find adorable.  Really??!

It IS mildly entertaining to watch the interaction between the burgeoning ""family""/senior citizen/Christian Sunday morning crowd (""Liam, sit down, honey.  Liam, Liam, Liam... stop that, Liam.  Stop licking the nice lady's scone.... it's not yours. LIAM!"") with the fit, handsome gay men, the brilliantly overweight and pierced/tattooed lesbians, pseudo business people, and liberal graduate students.  

Younger/trendy crowd seems to get drinks to go now.  Those who stay are ogled by mid lifers who want to know all about your computer or your cell phone and have no qualms about interrupting your work for a free tech lesson.  You also run the risk of toddlers sipping from your straw if your drink is left on the table.  

Or maybe you will enjoy being pushed out of the way by a 40 year old woman in yoga pants who simply MUST get her iced mocha right this second?  If not, you may want to get that coffee to go... quickly!  

The Sunday DJ is amazing.  His music could be my ""church"".  So, it was sad that today I could only hear toddlers, soccer moms, etc. yelling over the music about nothing of importance or interest.  :-(

Lastly, the internet connection comes and goes, mostly goes.  I have to tether with my cell phone because the wifi drops every hour or so.,Dear Seattle Supersonics and Howard Schultz,

I have forsaken Starbucks coffee since moving to AZ.  For one thing, Mr. Schultz, you suck (for selling the Sonics and for making a Grande latte $4.50).

I have moved on.  I am now--not so secretly--in love with Lux.  I get a ""medium"", otherwise known as grande to you, for $2.75 AND......ANDDDDD.......and my barista free pours the vanilla syrup.  I mean, it also tastes orgasmic, the coffee, that is.  By the way, I think their pastries are homemade.  Either way, their pastries are a DELIGHT!!  I always get the mixed berry corn bread muffin ($2.75) to go with my latte.  

Sincerely, 
A serious coffee addict

On a more serious note, they have outside seating with misters when the weather is scorching hot.  Since it's fall, the weather's been a lot nicer and this is a great hang out spot. They have their own parking and accept all major credit cards.  Their baristas are friendly and remember your name. This is a great place to get coffee and breakfast. No, they are not a franchise so you may have to drive a ways if you don't live in central phx...but hey, this is what makes their coffee affordable, orgasmic and worthwhile.  You should try them...at least once.,Opening night!  The food was fantastic.  Same great pastries and coffee/teas as Lux. But now with wine and food.  Had a great time.  Ambiance is fantastic.  There are two work/study areas and a large dining area.  Service was great.  Good selection of beers and wines.  Great addition to the coffee shop.  Extended hours - so for all you night owls it's fantastic.  Hope to spend more time here!,Upon entering this coffee shop immediately your senses are awakened to the smell of the many varieties of fresh ground coffee, your ear drums dance to the sounds provided by a techno DJ with a mixer linked to his laptop and large LCD display mounted over the coffee bar.  Take a look at the walls and let your eyes be guided by the abstract paintings, continue your scan as you find yourself among a unique culture of coffee drinkers interacting with their Apple human interface device.  After allowing my senses to take it all in I carefully sip the hot, steaming, light brewed coffee, ""Black"".,Man, this place is like something out of a movie, or magazine, or perhaps just real life.  I really love being in their space, and I love that after only three times, Danielle, who took my order, remembers my name, and knew the name of the guy behind me, too.  That sort of personal touch means a lot to me, and despite some of the pretense--like having a DJ on a Friday morning (spinning good tunes, I might add)--it's comfortable and fun.  

I like that they serve my Moroccan Mint tea in a cast-iron tea kettle.  I like how they cook all the goodies right there in the same space as the customers, and I like that the people who work there match the style of the space.  Wish they did pour overs and pressed coffee, though.  

Their mixed alcoholic drinks have all been excellent, although pricey.  My favorite is the slightly odd margarita they make, and it takes about five minutes to create, so be patient, but it's well worth the time.

Prepared food takes forever, especially if there's a line, so I suggest ordering a pastry behind the glass and a drip coffee if you are in a hurry, but then this isn't Starbucks, so don't come here if you need to rush off.,It is pretty cool that I have a awesome coffee shop right by my house.  I was so happy that my friend brought me here.  The price is right and it is way better then Starbucks. :)  They have a great variety of coffee and teas.   Wish I could give them 10 star rating.,I know this place has a rep for being a sort of hipster hangout, and it is, but the folks are friendly, helpful, and the coffee is outstanding. I had a problem connecting to WiFi but other than that, I'm in love.,Thought i'd update my review, with the new locale being open;

coffee, pastries, and environment all maintain their top-shelf qualities. inside seating room was always an issue, but not near as much anymore. And the places to sit are all very hip, cool set-ups - not just 10 look-a-like tables and chairs. 

My only problem? How they've laid out their customer flow. One prob at the old place was there was always an awkward bottleneck of people waiting for their drinks... and to my amazement, they've cloned the problem at their new place! Unreal! Whoever space-planned the new layout should be shot! ""i have an idea - because this place gets really busy, lets direct the long line of people into a little circle in front of the register, make this the same spot people wait for / pickup their drinks, and also the same place people use the condiment bar, and we'll have everyone awkwardly climbing over each other. Perfect!""

That said, their coffee is still the best in town. So there's that too.,There are so many reviews on Lux and I could just reiterate what's been said already ~ but they really do have incredible coffee and pastries!! 

Whether your a protagonist, fan or even if your dislike Lux, they have some of the best coffee is Phoenix and they have quite the following! This place is extremely busy ~ go figure!  

The aroma when you walk in is a savory fragrance of roasted coffee and is truly delightful.  Their coffee is full flavored with palatible goodness from start to finish.  Their homemade pastries are scumptious and compliment your cup of joe or hot tea very well.

The barista's are cool, friendly and very accomodating.  Lux is very small so most of the time I will get my cup of joe to go.  Their decor has a very ""coffee house"" feel and they have some seating outside which is user friendly below 100 degrees outside, lol! 

There are a lot of look-e-loos ~ people that like to stare at others.  Not sure why?  Maybe they think they know you or maybe they are looking for someone more interresting than the person they are with...,I'm going to skip past the obvious topic of coffee and tell you why the dessert selection at Lux Coffeebar is the best in town.

I almost didn't write this review since I'm at this Phoenix hot spot all the time.  However, I realized something earlier Saturday when I went inside a competitor's store searching for something to satisfy my sweet tooth.  

I walked in competitor x, scanned my choices, and walked out.  

That's when I made a beeline for Lux.  Hands down, Lux has the best dessert selection around.  Not only is everything made from scratch at this locally owned business, but the quality is outstanding, and in most cases the portions are generous.    

Wanna know the best part?  Sometimes the desserts have those crusty edges, you know, like homemade! The chain coffee houses might see this as a flaw - but at Lux the imperfections make this coffee bar perfect.

Lux is across the street from Central High School, just south of the Campbell and Central light rail station,,The coffee is amazing.  No one can challenge that.  I had kept telling the man about their coffee and how it reminded me of my favorite coffee place from when I lived in Seattle (Vivace.  Mmmmmm)  I had been to the old Lux and was curious to see the new one.  I was utterly confused.  There are three different counters.  The ""bar"" is in the back and distinguished by all the liquor bottles.  Easy enough.  But I had heard that they had sandwiches and what not now.  I saw an area that looked like where they made food, but was unsure as if I was supposed to order from them or from the barista.  When I asked if they had a menu, she said, ""We are your menu.""  Um.... ok.  Is that the hipster thing to do now?  I'm a girl who likes options.  I didn't know what my particular craving was that day and I like to know what my choices are.  I also like to know prices.  I ordered my old stand by of a medium vanilla soy latte and the man got a double espresso and it came out to almost $8. That was fine, just a little shocking and had there been prices listed anywhere, I would have known what to expect.  And instead of trying this food they allegedly have now, we got a pizza from Pane Bianco next door.  Which was incredible.,Oh Lux,  how I love thee....
I'll start by stating the obvious, the coffee/espresso  is superb. It's within walking distance from my place which is also fab. My favorite little treat is the velvet (which it seems, is some white chocolate concoction). I always feel like I want to throw up about 20 minutes after finishing it... this is a good thing kids, means it's like diesel fuel (or blow)  and I'll have uncontrollable facial twitching for hours without the cost of either. woot!

Another thing I must mention is the adorable inked up little hipster cat behind the bar. This kid can froth my milk anytime. Sure, I probably couldn't fit into his ""skinny"" jeans or whatever but still..... rawr.  

So if you're like me and you have a penchant for amazingly yummy java and pretty, possibly sexually confused, skinny boys that are WAY to young for you, pop in to Lux.

You can thank me later......,Hipsters, Hipsters, Hipsters everywhere and not a drop of decent coffee.

The coffee was mediocre at best. One of the worst iced carmel/vanilla lattes I've ever had. It was in a 16oz cup that costed more then a venti at Starbucks. Was this because of superior quality? Hardly. Hipsters can't make decent cup of joe. Its too mainstream for them. I was in the area, and remember seeing it, so I wanted to give it a try.

The atmoshpere was crowded and cluttered. Overall just messy. I feel like I walked into a sweat shop. OH did I mention hipsters? The pastries looked good. But i'd never purchese anything from greasy hipsters without it being FDA approved. And these bitches were making cupcakes in plain view.

If I ever were to come back, it would be to simply take pictures of all the patrons and post them at LATFH.com,yes, hipsters still abound in this space but the coffee and pastries are yum!,Well I love this place, is my fave coffee of all... but isn't great to study or have a conversation bcz their music is too loud, is always packed (bcz is that good) also the ambient and the style of the place is very cool, different  of what u can expect in the middle of the streets in phx central area. also the employees r very cool, know u by name and show u that care for ur order.... i will say is great specially for a weekends mornings or evening... is like a great place to meet somebody by the first time like a ""relax, first date"" hahaha... check it out,I must admit I feel so uncool every time I come in here, mostly because it's hipster supreme and everyone seems to know everyone. But I sit in here and work because the atmosphere is both simple and eclectic -- I love the openness behind the counter and the openness of the seating area. Plus, good tunes always seem to abound here. Did I mention the coffee is delicious? Smooth, caramelly espresso; not at all the like the bitter over roasted crud at a certain worldwide coffee tyrant. I also highly dig that they worked the tax into all of their prices, so when I buy an Americano for $2.50, it's really $2.50. One more thing: enjoy the pastries here. They are as good as any coffeehouse I've visited.,02.06.10

Is this where all the cool college kids hang out with their shades and their laptops to people-watch?

If not, it should be.

Iced coffee gets the job done.

The restroom stocks fancy products!,I don't drink coffee but my husband said it was great.  I had a breakfast sandwich that was pretty good and my husband had a blueberry muffin.  I like the idea behind the seating and cafe but it was easy to feel like an outsider.  I would like to go back again and try some of their other baked goods that looked delicious.,How do they do it?  Consistently outstanding coffee AND baked goods that should be on the food network!  Recently, I've been wow'ed by the bananas foster croissant creation, blueberry-pear anything, and, my numero uno favorite is the blueberry corn muffin.  A few weeks ago they had blueberry pie.  Not your ordinary blueberry sticky filling... this pie slice was loaded with fruit & flavor!  I just hope this mystery baker doesn't get discovered and go to Hollywood!  As for one of the previous reviews regarding their iced coffee.... that person must have a Starbucks palate, because LUX has the best iced coffee in the city!!,A great place to lounge by yourself. The coffee and teas are great. I love the White Chocolate Mocha; your taste buds will love it, your hips may not.

Don't go there expecting people to be friendly, it feels more like a library. Everyone generally keeps to themselves with their eyes glued to their various screens.,Whip cream .. red velvet .. yeah im going here tomorrow,After two great visits to Lux, I can't think of any negatives to affect the star rating. Lux has everything I can imagine for a coffee shop. Freshly roasted beans, baristas who know what they're doing, (AND look like they're having a good time doing it), an outdoor shaded patio with funky wood tables and indoor seating with mismatched modern chairs, delicious baked goods (some guiltier than others), beautiful local artwork on the walls (a photography display today), and an actual DJ playing music for the lingerers' enjoyment! It goes without saying that the coffee is delicious. 
Both times I went in, the guy at the counter offered advice on my choices (the scone he suggested was indeed delicious, not overly sweet, but perfectly buttery), and no one pressured me to get through the line, as often happens at other places where people have their order down pat. I also enjoyed the company of other Lux patrons both times I went, and savored my coffee outside on the patio with a good book.,i like lux- there's something about getting my foam in the shape of a leaf that makes me giggly and feel fancy. i also think it's cool that they have a bar but other than that, i can take it or leave it. there's not enough seating and why am i going to sit ouside all year if i can't smoke? i know that's my issue but there are plenty of other coffee shops in phoenix and tempe that have impressed me with their actual drinks and atmosphere,I have been drinking the same espresso drink for about 6 years now, and Lux does the best job at making it! I found this place when I lived in Phoenix, and I literally went there every morning at 7am. I would order my drink and sit there and read. The coffee drinks are fantastic and it may have to do with the fact that they roast their own beans.  The pastries are also great, and they are baked fresh in the mornings. They have comfortable chairs to lounge on and read a good book. They also have tables that can seat up to 8 people, so it is a nice place to meet up with a group of friends. There is also seating outside under a shaded area. 

There is a morning rush, but the staff is quick and there are parking spaces to the north of the building and also to the south. It is a hip, cool place with hip, cool customers.,I have been to Lux many times for meetings, to kill time, to read a book, to get some coffee before I head to my downtown destination...

I hadn't been in a while and we had some extra time before the play started, so we headed to lux for an Iced Americano, a strawberry italian soda and 2 cupcakes... and then 2 more cupcakes.

The drinks were great and cupcakes... perfect!

I read my book and he did his crossword puzzle and we hung out for an hour and a half.  They were playing Hot Hot Heat and the paintings on the walls were very good.  

I need to try to get over here more often.,My favorite local cafe!  So much personality!  It has that whole industrial, arty urban chic vibe going on.  Cool local art on the walls.  Always great music on (sometimes a little loud, so if you're easily distracted or trying to chat don't sit right under the speakers).  Amazing home-baked tasty little goodies -- something different every day!  Usually with vegan alternatives, and at least one reasonably healthy choice, including fresh fruit.  Just had their no-bake chocolate-peanut butter-oatmeal cookies -- which were seriously yum!  Still my favorite is the ciabatta-style toasted bread with real butter and Nutella alongside one of their perfect soy lattes...- heaven!  And yes, they do roast their own coffee beans here, so if you come in during roasting time, you may leave smelling like freshly roasted coffee!,What can I say that hasn't already been said? Lux is a breath of fresh air in a city cluttered with boring chain coffee joints. From the modern, eclectic aesthetics to the masterfully prepared drinks (including the yummy homemade, scoop-able whipped cream!) and the laid-back staff, Lux is always a treat. 

A life-long Phoenician, I've always had the ""stay away from strangers"" mentality. When I first went to Lux I was dismayed that even at a ""slow"" time I was forced to sit either on the same couch or at the same table as a stranger. Now I have assimilated to the environment that provides ample opportunity to easily strike up a conversation with fellow Lux-goers. Thank you Lux for melting this cold-stranger-averse exterior! 

The only reason I cannot give Lux 5 stars is the lack of outdoor comforts. The picnic-style tables stand in stark contrast to the comfortable seats and atmosphere found indoors. On a beautiful spring/fall night (which I can only dream of at this time of year), I want to sit outdoors in comfortable seats, with a good cup of coffee and enjoy great conversation. Work with me Lux! 

In summation, if you like great coffee (or yummy baked goods!) and a fun, energetic atmosphere, Lux is the place for you. :),I haven't reviewed Lux yet, because so many of you have already got after it.  But the time has come and I must make my comment.

There isn't much to say.  Lux simply makes the best coffee in Phoenix.  I dare someone to challenge me on this fact.  It's a Saturday morning, and I have some work to do, but don't feel like staying home or heading into the office, you will find me sipping a great cup of joe and snipping some FREE WIFI!!

The only issue I have is this has become such a hot spot for everyone.  Why can't people keep secrets??????,Best coffee I've had from a coffee shop, delicious drinks, friendly staff and comfortable environment. The house coffee was always strong and bold, but has a smooth earthy flavor. The bloody mary was my favorite late saturday drink, it was spicy and perfect. I give four stars instead of five because of the heartbreaking horrible pastries. A pastry should taste delicious and colorful and beautiful. Fuck the fat and sugar....it is a PASTRY folks. The pastries here taste like a bowl of plain oatmeal. Anyway, other than that this place is awesome.,This place serves up a good cup of coffee and I LOVE the cheap refills on my Americanos. They also serve a lot of yummy looking pastries and other goodies. One of my top three coffee places in Phoenix. Has a real cool vibe and they are always playing good tunes. 
The interior is a mish-mash of ultramodern furniture, some long benches and some old hand-me-down furnishings. Somehow all these incongruities add up to something unique and cool.
I also LOVE the hours they keep. I can pop in for an Americano (decaf after 6:00pm) at 9:00pm and hang out and chill for a while.
Just beware, this place (rightfully so) is ALWAYS packed and parking can be tough. But don't let that deter you.,Loved this place. Super chic and quaint. Yes, there are many college kids and lawyers there, but, I kind of liked it.  It reminds me of a cafe one might find in San Fransico or Brooklyn. The place is huge, so, it isn't that hard to find seating, you just might have to spend a little effort looking (there are nooks and crannies everywhere). The coffee was excellent, loved my latte. It's so awesome they have such an assortment of home made pastries; there is something for everyone's tastes, I'm sure. I only wish I lived closer.,coffee is really good but it is packed- hard to find a place to sit, unless you go outside. Nice pastries.,Lux is my favorite, everything here is fantastic. All the barista's know your drink and have a welcome smile to see you. Pastries are made on site, ample in selection and are delicious. If you think you're too chubby for cake there's usually fresh fruit hanging around and yogurt in the mornings. Free wi-fi and free people watching are a bonus to this dimly lit and cozy atmosphere.,I like come to Lux  and pretend study. I've graduated college already but I like to come here and pretend like I'm doing something important while I sip on some coffee, check my Facebook account, check how many cool votes I got on Yelp and check the movie times using their free wi-fi. 

The place gets packed on the weekend so be prepared to have to scope the room out for an empty spot at the table or wait for someone to finish. I never usually have to wait very long.

The staff here is super helpful. If you don't see something on the menu, just let them know what you normally drink and they can make it for you. The selection of treats are amazing. Cherry oatmeal bars, snickerdoodles and diner cake. If the coffee doesn't get you wired, the sugar might. 

Its fairly quiet and has some music on but I usually just bring earplugs so I can secretly listen to Britney Spears. No one has to know about that. The guys who frequent this place are pretty cute, except their usually gay. Oh well... a girl can dream, can't she?!,this has always been my favorite coffee shop in phoenix.  the organic lattes are the fuel that powers me through this crazy world!

i love the ambiance, the people, the food, the art, the music, the couches and of course the coffee. (these guys roast their own beans incase you didn't know)

i have not had the privilege of dining here yet, but i'm sure it is a wonderful experience like everything else.  jeff has done an amazing job breathing life into the new location.

i truly feel the heart of my community every time i am at lux.,Stopped in with my two yr old granddaughter today after going to the children's museum, got some raised eyebrows when the cool people  saw the kid but whatever I had to have one of there dirty chai's. Good as usual and the kiddo had a cupcake she thoroughly enjoyed on the drive home.,Could this place be anymore fantastic!? 

They have better coffee than any coffee bar I have been to..including *GASP*...STARBUCKS!!! 

They have alcohal and food. Their drinks are made perfectly! I love being able to enjoy a drink while studying. Their food is great too! I LOVE their mac and cheese! its only $5 but tastes like a million bucks! 

Im kinda obsessed with this place, i go here about 3 to 4 times a week.

p.s. they are th",0.281771
Lola Coffee,"Talk about working with what you have and pushing the envelope!
I am not a fan of the location, and I wish it were a bit more Spanish  Meditteranean in its housing.  I wish that I could just shake that image.
But for all that was missing in a Spanish breeze, there was nothing lacking in the red or white SANGRIA!  Choose white before 5pm and red after 7pm.  Then, get a real tortilla...the egg and potato kind... 

Try their vegan offerings. My two friends tried several items and there was not one that we did not love.  The others who shared the long benched table outback with us were also smiling as they allowed themselves to be comfortable eating and drinking with strangers.

The place next door kept playing competing music, but when i could hear the spanish guitar music, it made me very  excited about the promise of the power of tiny dishes of tantilizing tidbits tingling my tongue teasingly.  

Full marks because the service was equally sensational and appropriate.  Tapas as they should be...even when they need a new  Spanish designed house to be served from.,Oh, how I do love an unfriendly judgy person who's about to take my order. Sarcasm anyone? Call me crazy but I like to be greeted with a smile.
I'm looking at the damn board trying to find the chai tea latte prices. Where the heck is the chai listed?!
I deem their chai as bland anyway. Unless their blend changes I'll never go back.
Side note: Cool chandelier. But walking through people to order sucks.,I wish I lived closer to this little gem! I am a huge coffee fan. I seek out specialty coffee and coffee shops where ever I land. I travel a lot and work a lot, so caffeine is a must for me and I hate bad coffee.

This place makes an amazing cappuccino and the sweets and pastries are fresh. There is a lot of seating and it isn't overly hipster, but just enough to be interesting. 

Really great roast.,Great coffee, great atmosphere!!!!
I can concentrate on my PC work and sketch there!
Very good quality coffee, also great customer service.
I love the interior of the space, too. Very warmth wooden style, big window, and great furniture.

This is the place I go when I am in Phoenix!!!,Let me just say, my friends would tell you, I am a coffee snob. 
I used to go to LUX way before they stuffed it full of furniture and became way too popular. (Hello, this is phoenix, can you offer some shade?) BUT now there is Lola Coffee and I can't remember the last time I went to LUX.
The first time I went to this location I was instantly reminded of my favorite Portland coffee, stumptown. I love the fact that you can smell the coffee roasting as you get near. It just has a great vibe and has decorated in true minalmalist fashion (yes, lux, this is what it looks like) My favorite drink is the iced coffee, they put 2 shots of espresso in there, and I didn't even ask, Thank you! The pastries are always top notch as well. I am still in shock that someone said their coffee is no better than Starbucks. Have some respect, geesh!,Lola Coffee is a great coffee shop with plenty of room to move around and delicious coffee and pastries.  

Daniel Wayne, founder of Lux Coffee before he sold it and opened Lola Coffee.  It's located not far from Lux and it's a nice change when you need some additional room to meet with someone.

Their coffee is house roasted off site and very good.  They have different varieties of coffee depending on the seasonality and availability.  They have a small selection of cookies and pastries but it's their tarts that set them apart from other places.  Their tarts are divine and luscious.  They also offer some unique cold beverages such as fresh agave lemonade and a variety of iced /hot teas. 

The Coffee may be a little better at Lux but Lola doesn't have near as many creepy look-e-loo peeps that stare at you while you're trying to enjoy your cup of joe :-),Lola is a great coffee shop in downtown Phoenix. Whether you are from the area or looking for a new spot, it's a great place.  For starters they have a great Blanco and Mocha coffee, with the best whip cream I've had (they flavor it with espresso). The vibe is hip and they feature rotating local art. 

The drawbacks for Lola are poorly designed seating and their breakfast menu. The room fills up artificially quick because most of the seating is occupied by one person while being designed for 2 or 4 people. Coming to Lola with another person or *gasp* more can be a problem if you want to sit together! Also, they have one of the worst omelets ever. Seriously. Denny's is better. They are not a restaurant, they are a coffee shop trying to expand their offerings- sadly it was done poorly. If you want a bite here, get a baked good- they won't blow you away but they won't remind you of the LOST finale (that's the omelet!). 

On a side note, the last time I went to Lola (about 2 months ago) I had the worst customer service experience of my life. It's not worth going into, and it certainly does not represent the otherwise great people, but without that trip I would have been hard pressed to give Lola at least 4 stars.,Lola is like Lux's bourgeois older sister. You want to hate her for her materialistic/conformist ways and then you wake up and realize that you are her. Skinny jeans don't look good on YOU...they look good on your 20-something 90lb sis. Yeah yeah, you're hip...but that shaggy mop top shit doesn't translate well to the boardroom. The only thing you have in common at this point is your stupid Prius.

You've grown up kid. 

It's a little hard to accept at times, but you will. Your penchant for malnourished, tattooed, possibly sexually confused boys has given way to men. Grownups with stability, good jobs and a formal education. Your idea of a good time has gone from $1.00 PBR specials to 50% off any bottle of wine deals. It's been a long time coming darlin' but you're ready. Embrace, with love, these changes because you can't do shit about it....and you can't live in the past. 

(Believe it or not, this ENTIRE review was about coffee),Great place for a business meeting. All too often I find myself agreeing to meet at Starbucks but prefer to find locally run coffee houses to meet at. The service at Lola's has always been great, the coffee has always been good, and that translates into better business meetings for me.

I highly recommend meeting at Lola's when in north central Downtown Phoenix.,Whatever Lola wants.  Go and support your local coffee shops and stop supporting Dr. Evil and his Starbucks.  Oh Behave!

I wish there was one of these places where I live, but I gather Downtown PHX is not too far.  Lola's is a small quaint coffee shop with some good vibes; really relaxing and chill.

I'm a regular coffee drinker plain black -- no sugar or cream.  Overall, I didn't think it blew my mind away, but can't beat the atmosphere.,Awesome coffee, incredible sweets. Nice, quiet and just around the corner.

I'd humbly ask for more power outlets for us home office types who need a getaway spot!,I too was eagerly awaiting this place's arrival. I'm a sucker for both coffee and Lola Tapas, so naturally I was intrigued. It was well worth the wait, even on the first day of business. Great, smooth espresso and awesome pastries from Sweet Pea's Danielle Librera. I dig the whole vibe going on here; it fits in very well next to Haus and the other little shops in this ever-evolving plaza. The retro modern feel and color scheme make it one of the more lively coffee spots in these parts (that's a good thing) and I love the little diner touch with the bar stools looking out onto Central Ave. Judging from the crowd they had at 6:30 p.m. on their first day of business, I'd say we have a winner.,What's most important about this second outpost of Lola Coffee is that it doesn't stray from its original formula and doesn't neglect the history of the Gold Spot building. High ceilings, lots of natural light, old-time fixtures and concrete floors -- I imagine this is what the old grocery looked like some 80 years ago in this very spot. Nicely done!

What really makes this spot better than the original location is the full roastery room and kitchen. So, while you're enjoying your cup of coffee, you can smell the sweet, smokey goodness of Lola Espresso Roast wafting up the rafters, as well as the heavenly perfection of Sweet Pea baked goods. You can't beat that.,It pains me to do this but I gotta say that I broke up with Lola a few months ago and I'm finally in a place to talk about it.  

When it comes to my loyal patronage, I take everything personal.  Like visiting a shop on opening day and subsequently 2-4 x a week for months thereafter...I sorta expect at least one or two people to know my name considering they write it on a cup each time I order the same drink.  The honeymoon phase lasted a few months and Lola Tapas transfer Michelle was endearing and efficient.  But over time the romance began to fade.  

The coffee joined the pastry in the hit and miss category and the service became pretty unpredictable.  

The very last time my husband and I went we were SO excited to visit the new Roosevelt location and that experience became the deal-breaker.  The owner barely acknowledged us even though we've been loyal for years, the coffee was disappointing and the pastry was horrific.  We took one bite, a few sips and left most of it unconsumed on our table.  

Somewhere along the line, this place lost its soul for me and I'm really not sure if I'll ever be back.  I must admit that I have still not found the cup of coffee this place used to deliver...but I'd rather keep looking than feel like a dollar sign.,I have passed this place so many times and I always say I am going to stop and try it!  I finally did and I am so glad I did.  I love chai lattes so of course I had to try theirs.  It was awesome!  It was the perfect amount of sweetness and spice.  The atmosphere is open and it looks like a great place to come with some friends or to just come by yourself with your laptop and do what you need to do.  The girl was by herself behind the counter so she was a little overwhelmed but its ok because my drink was great!  Thank you!,If nothing else, Lola serves THE BEST MOCHA ON EARTH!  They also have a nice selection of fresh baked goods. The atmosphere is laid back and is conducive to relaxing and listening to the good tunes they usually have playing. The service is efficient but in the past sometimes the folks behind the counter seem to have a little attitude which is a little off-putting. However the last time I was here the girl who took my order was so sweet and was the barista. A little attitude would never stop me from coming in, but my visit was all the more pleasant with a few smiles and some friendly banter.,Lola embodies what supporting local businesses is all about! They have put together a first rate business that consistently serves GREAT coffee and offers a fine selection of pastries.

The atmosphere is awesome with large windows facing the street that let in plenty of sunlight. Awesome tunes are always playing and I particularly dig the retro stereo. I always pop in just before work so I have yet to spend time and soak up the atmosphere, but this is a local business that Phoenix can be proud of.,love it here! the pastries are always excellent and baked fresh at their other site. Its a pretty big place, there are always seats inside and out, which is really nice. The service was great and very friendly. They have really incredible whip on drinks- it has coffee flavor in it, so totally worth the extra calories :),I just luv this place! I luv the BIG cups and the staff is VERY friendly!!,The lemon shortbread was wonderful! Soft and just a bit more than a ""hint"" of lemon. The flavor was perfect! I would eat the shortbread any time!,Please don't kill me---while I really do like this place, and hope it succeeds, i can't yet give it 4 stars....

So, as everyone else said, the decor is awesome.  I'd be happy to steal every piece of furniture (especially the light fixture!) and take it home for myself.  And, I do like the idea of an open kitchen, though I also wonder if it will really work for a coffee shop when/if it gets busy.  

The coffee is good.  Not write home to your mom good---but nothing in Phoenix meets that standard.  So, this looses a star---goes from 5 to 4. 

And then the move from 4 to 3: I walked in and immediately there was this strange smell.  After sitting there for a while, I didn't notice it anymore.   I don't know if it was a one time thing, or something with their space, or what.  But... 

Some final comments: It was relatively empty, which made it easier to work at than, say, Lux.  (But, also made it less friendly....)  They seem to have a great music system but not yet great music.  And, as someone else commented, the crowd does seem to be older than at Lux.  

... But this all was based on one visit....,I working in coffee for three years and its often hard to find a spot I want to give money to. Lola I can dig though. I think the owners name is David, but regardless- he makes the blend of coffee they use. The blend is brilliant and full of flavor. The staff is always friendly and the spot just looks great; the furniture, the art, the music. Great modern coffee house vibe.,Lola Coffee, a new favorite.

[Repeat refrain. And enjoy the coffee.],Pretty good coffee! Friendly barista. Ambience is totally lay back. If you expect fancy, got the wrong place here, the decor is between industrial and forgotten in time classroom furniture. But if it's a good cup of cafe you seek, then you're in good company, give their matador (mocha n cinnamon) a try, it has a good balance between the two flavors n coffee!,This place is pretty fantastic. I actually felt like I was in a real life city when I was sitting here the other day on my laptop looking out the window. I sorely miss living in a real life city, specifically Boston, so places like this make me super happy. 

Staff are really cool and helpful. Its spacious and clean, and I don't feel like everyone in the place can see my screen, not that there is anything weird on there... okay there probably is, but bottom line is no one else is staring over my shoulder making me feel self conscious about shit I enjoy looking at on the internet. 

The coffee is delicious and strong. Nothing worse than a weak cup'o joe. I had a pot of their Orange Detox also, which wasn't terrible, but I could tell they used tap water.. I loathe tap water and can immediately tell a difference because I think the tap here tastes absolutely fucking disgusting. I still drank it though, because the chick promised me it would help me feel better.. Guess what, I sneezed all night. 

O'well.

Another thing I liked about this place is that there aren't 500 hipsters or emo-assholes sitting around looking depressed.. maybe I was lucky that day because it wasn't very crowded at all. So yeah, I dug Lola, and the prices are CHEAP. Thankfully this is yet another groovy coffee shop in the valley that is there to help me avoid the Corporate Whore that is Starbucks.,I returned to this place a couple of times, most recently was this week. Somehow the coffee hasn't tasted as good as the first time. What I really like about this place is that when I'm near downtown Phoenix on a week night, and need a spot with good coffee, a very clean restroom, not too crowded, decent current magazines to read,  and definitely good funky yet nondistracting music that is turn on at a decent lounging volume provides an overall comfortable experience.,I enjoyed meeting Gabi and some other Yelpers for  ""Office Hours"" here today. 

I liked the space, the bathroom was clean and cool, the staff was friendly and both my hot beverages were great. 

I enjoyed a Hot Chocolate and then a cup of the ""peace on earth"" tea which I preferred over the HC. 

The tea was perfect and decaffeinated, I didn't even need to add anything to it. I don't remember what exactly the tea was made up with but I'm sure I will be back just to enjoy another cup. 

Only drawbacks for me are, parking is limited and they don't serve any lunch items but other than that its a great spot!,I found this place on my phone ""place"" app. and decided to try it out. After all, I needed a place to focus and do some school work. 

The only downside is that they don't have a chai tea latte, which I always get. 

I got a Cafe Latte instead, which was great. 

I love the atmosphere and definitely the free WiFi because I needed to do work. They do play loud music though, in case for some of you who like to work in silence. 

Overall, love it and very close to the lightrail.,amazing! amazing! amazing! coffee! and customer service! i have gone 3x to lola's coffee and each time ive had great customer service and good coffee - im addicted to their cup of joe called ""the matador"" yum! i give thumbs up to lola's they truly know how to run a coffeebar and make enjoyable and favorable coffee - thx guys!,Been coming here for past 6 months.  And I have not looked for any other coffee joints.  Coffee is superb!  I love it here, the owner definitely has passion and great taste.,First of all, I'm glad that Lola moved in to this space. I miss Calabria, but I'm glad something worthy has taken over this spot that serves delectable things.

Thanks to Chef Danielle (formerly of Sweet Pea Bakery), Lola's baked goods are worth dreaming about. If you ever find macarons (perhaps this is the French spelling?), then you have to purchase one or two because those things are to die for.

I like the ambiance, I like the staff and people who frequent it. It's a good crowd, mostly on their laptops or busy reading their books or newspapers.

Here's my one and only complaint: They don't make their drip coffee hot enough.

I'm a simple gal. I don't ask for those mocha, macchiato, extra foam, skinny-skinny, with drizzle and powder on top kinda drinks. I just want simple brewed coffee with some room for my cream.

The first time I purchased coffee at Lola's, it was served in a cup because I chose to drink it there. And it was already lukewarm, therefore, it was ""iced"" coffee by the time I had my second sip. The next time, I asked for it in a to-go cup, thinking that the lid might keep the coffee warmer longer. Alas, the drip coffee was lukewarm after my third sip. The last time I was there (3 days ago), I asked for them to put in a to-go cup again and to make it a little hotter than usual. Oh, it was hot alright, but maybe just 2 notches above their usual ""warm.""

I'm not looking for scalding coffee but just hot enough for me to enjoy hot coffee a little longer while reading the Arts section of the Arizona Republic (and there's really not much content in that section).

Can't a girl ever get hot coffee from there? That's all she asks.,I love Lola Coffee....I stopped by here the other to get some coffee. Awesome cinnamony (is that even a word?) mexican coffee... lol and the cinnamon coffee cake. Great pastries!  I also like the ambiance. I love supporting local business like this.,The interior of Lola Coffee is beautiful. It is all one room, (even behind the counter) and neatly sectioned by the arrangement of the furniture rather than walls or building floorplan. This is an expert way of dealing with the existing design of the space, rather than tearing up floors and knocking down walls. Furthermore, the (from what I could tell) original ceiling support beams of the building were also left intact, painted, and incorporated as part of the overall design in a very elegant manner. 

All in all, I was very impressed at the interior design at Lola. Even though it's a bit like a Eurway showroom, everything is well placed and cohesive. 

Beyond the visual aesthetics, my coffee was great. I ordered just a plain latte, which was precisely what I was hoping for. There was an assortment of  pastries at the counter, which from what I understand are the work of Sweet Pea Bakery. I tried the cinnamon coffee cake, which was delicious. The crumble topping on the coffee cake was rich and crusty, and the cake was moist and tart, almost carrot cake-like. 

It's obvious that the baristas here are still trying to get in the groove of the flow of service and developing a system for taking orders/serving food/making drinks, etc. But this is definitely related to the place barely being open a week. That being said, I was quite impressed with Lola and foresee the cafe doing very well. I'm going to be back soon.,Stopped in here for a quick drink + snack while waiting for a friend to finish her wedding rehearsal at Brophy Chapel across the street.  

Between the two of us, hubby and I had a lemonade, iced coffee and some sort of ganache cake concoction.  All were pretty good.  The barista was friendly, sweet and attentive, and the ambiance was upscale hipster.  Easy parking and not too crowded.,Good Coffee, Friendly service for the most part
Haven;t tried their food yet, but the baked goods are BOMB. 

Check it out if you are on the west side of downtown. 


weird hours
don't open until seven.,This my favorite coffeehouse in Phoenix. It combines excellent coffee, coffee culture, a great space, and good service.

Daniel Wayne is no stranger to the coffee business. He has worked in Phoenix, studied in Italy, started a coffee business in Seattle and two in Phoenix. I really think he is has a superb palate, respect for tradition while not shunning the modern, and a great eye for style. He is also very humble and gracious. His roasting style shows evidence of having spent time in Italy: not afraid of caramelization and a clear focus on balance + complexity. Daniel is a fine barista and I always ask him to make my drink, if he is at the store.

Coffee culture is definitely apparent. From the espresso machine to the roaster seen clearly through a window in the seating area, it is a place serious about coffee without being overbearing.

The space is outstanding. First of all it is ""real place"". It was an old market, I think and has perfect light, due to its orientation, windows, and high ceiling. Daniel pulls together an eclectic assemblage of vintage chairs, drafting tables, a glass door for a menu, and an old school console stereo w giant dorm speakers. The elements work together to make a relaxing urban space. Daniel plays vinyl and we both are huge Cat Stevens fans. He played the ""Tea for the Tillerman"" album for me on my last visit, which made my day.

Not sure why they get slammed for service. I have always been treated well by all of the staff. They may not have the ""may I take your order, please"" smiley service attitude, but are respectful and kind. It is a great place to hang out for hours or just get well crafted espresso drink and a pastry.,I met a friend at Lola Coffee last week for First Friday but I didn't have any time to spend inside the place.  Oh how I now regret not showing up an hour earlier!  I went back yesterday to experience what Lola had to offer.  I sooooo dug on this place!!  For me this place has some of what I miss about the Bay Area and Sacramento.  It's a great coffeehouse on a busy street in a vibrant part of the city.  I couldn't name all the cool tunes I heard playing over the audio system but I'm pretty sure there was some Depeche Mode (and I'm a product of the 80s/90s).  I had myself a double mocha with whipped cream.  The whipped cream was one of the best decisions I've made in a week.  You see, some dairy alchemist decided to infuse the whipped cream with some vanilla and espresso.  All I have to say about that is if the whipped cream spun it would be called DJ YummyTron!!!  So I sat down and chilled flipping through an interior design book with a forward by Joely Fisher and sipping on my mocha (I later moved on to reading an issue of NY Times Magazine talking about people who worry a lot).  I soon became distracted by the light-rail going by and a bunch of old cars roaring up and down the street (not gonna lie to you, there was some eye-candy of the femme variety in the place too).  I soon came to absolutely treasure the huge window fronting Central Ave.  Only downside was I don't have a laptop so I couldn't be one of the cool kids surfing the web while sipping my drink.  They had a woman come in and put together some floral arrangements which I thought was a nice touch (and I told them as much).  Go, sip, listen, watch, and enjoy!!!,This is my review of the opening night:

I am a huge fan of the other Lola Coffee so when they said they were opening another location I knew I wanted to give it a try.  

I showed up pretty much right at 7pm on opening day Dec. 18 2009.  I went inside and asked if they were taking credit cards on opening night.  They said that they weren't charging on opening night which was very nice.  So I went and ordered my standard double-mocha.  While I was waiting I took in the visuals the new Lola has to offer.  This location seems to have a front of house that is smaller than the Central Ave. location however this is the opposite of a bad thing.  The slightly smaller size lends an intimacy to the place that is very inviting.  It has significantly higher ceilings and the hallway leading out the back door has two cozy and somewhat secluded tables (this would be great if you and your honey wanted to have some quality time together).  The decor is what I would classify as modern with some exposed structural elements in the front of the coffeehouse, a distressed table, and some nice metalwork.  You're also treated to the sight of a coffee bean roaster towards the back of the room.

I got my mocha and, since I was one of the first arrivals, had no problem finding a table (the distressed one).  As I sat sipping my drink and  perusing a book about the Great Barrier Reef I noticed that the place filled with people very quickly.  I ended up talking to an employee of Lola Coffee North (or LoNo as I call it now) for a while.  I then spoke to another woman associated with the business about some of Lola's green features.  It was then time for me to go so I retrieved my bicycle and headed to the nearby Central/Roosevelt light-rail station.

PS: the coffee was very good.,I can't review their coffee because the rude salesgirl wouldn't let us buy any. We came here around 7pm on a Friday. The door says they are open until 10. The yelp profile says the same. She was on the phone with a friend gossiping when we came in. We stand there for at least 5mins before she noticed and said ""oh yeah, we're closed."" wtf?,I am only giving four stars as of now because I have only been here once. But the quality and taste of their coffee, along with a super friendly staff and customers, has led me to yelp! :o)

Seriously though... their coffee is delicious! Super strong, super flavorful and just all around amazing. I find nice coffee shops are not hard to find... however, finding ones that have GOOD COFFEE certainly is!

I plan on going to Lola Coffee again soon... as in today =)

Atmosphere seemed nice for the time I was in there and the location is convenient.,This review will get right to the point.  I had some time to kill before an early morning meeting today, so I gave Lola a try. 

Espresso = Awesome
Service = Awesome
Atmosphere & Music = Awesome

Everyone that stopped in while I was there all seemed very happy, which rubbed off on me.  I'll be back.,Good coffee, sometimes a little burnt. Pastries great.,I use to go to Lola often since I lived about 10 min away. It's a funky little place with some tasty mochas. Wish I lived closer.,Great coffee and great prices. A spacious inside and tables out back are just the beginning. This coffee house is the place to chill on a nice afternoon. The staff seems genuinely happy and pleased to explain their different options. Service is quick, too.

The coffee itself is rich and flavorful. It is fresh tasting, and they offer all variety of swetening options, including raw sugar. The portions are reasonable, and drinks not just loaded with milk and syrup.

If you are looking for a place to relax and catch up on your emails without feeling alone or rushed, this is it. Warning: you might become a regular!,The real test of a coffee house is not how it prepares its specialty drinks...(let's face it, enough sugar and cream can make anything taste good).   No, the real test of a coffee house is how their black, regular drip tastes.    I like it complex, rich, and nutty.     

How disappointing that Lola's regular drip is weak, watery, and tasteless.     

Pastries are great, though.     Ambience is cool...though it's echo-y and a little loud if you want to carry on a conversation.     

Step up the coffee and I'll be back,I make a point of coming here when I'm downtown.  Great place to hang out and get some work done.  I don't drink coffee but great teas and I like their muffins as much as I did the Lola on Camelback.  Not a ton of outdoor seating but I'm usually working inside so not a huge issue for me.  All the girls who work here are great too, very friendly and helpful.  Very cool music too..it's toughto beat this combination of good atmosphere, good staff, good food and good music in a cool, urban, transitioning neighborhood.  Wish I lived closer.,I LOVE this place! I'm a Cartel Coffee devotee and I'd had Lola coffee at La Grande Orange before, but I don't know what it was.  Lola has won a new follower.  The pastries that we tried (tart and muffins) were terrific. I love that It's SUPER close to the light rail which is perfect for us. I like that i didn't feel squished up too close to other people and I heard there's another one downtown so I'm going to try that one next.,So far, I have been to Lola twice (a Saturday night and Monday morning). Saturday night was very quiet compared to the super busy Monday morning. Free Wi-Fi, coffee, baked goods, and awesome location...you can't beat it. The morning we went, we had a Monterrey Jack scone that was really good. I laughed when I got my latte in a ""So I Married an Axe Murder""-esque cup. We sat along the high tables facing Central Ave and I really enjoyed surfing the internet and looking out towards Central. There are various types of seating as well as some outdoor tables. I really loved this place but worry that it will be one of those places that will be so popular, you'll never get to sit there. That is why I stopped going to Lux because it eventually got so crowded all of the time. My favorite part of Lola coffee is being right on Central and watching traffic and the light rail go past. Love it, love it.,Another local coffee shop (rhymes with Mucks) was my place until recent events left me with a bad taste in my mouth... literally and figuratively.

Lola's is more than an adequate replacement: it is now my choice in Phoenix for coffee.  The iced coffee woke me up a",0.274696
Lo-Fi Coffee,"I love Lo-Fi!   This is definitely my new favorite place to hang out in Mesa.  
Plenty of seating for me and my friends, and you don't feel rushed or uncomfortable or that you're giving money to the devil for sub-par drinks, like at *bux.   
They had a special- lattes for $2 the other night... I can't remember the last time i got coffee so cheap.  The iced teas are my favorite though.   Plus the guy who's always working there, Sam, once brought my friend a cup of ice water when he noticed she didn't order a drink... how thoughtful! 
Thanks for keeping us all hydrated :)      

Also - Vegan baked goods = thumbs up.. I'm not vegan but this chocolate cookie with peanut butter inside was so awesome!

My friend said the biscotti is great as well.,The drinks, service and atmosphere at Lo Fi are about the best around. Sam will pour you a perfect cup of whatever you want with a smile and some friendly banter.

The prices are very reasonable, especially when you consider the quality of the drinks.

As for food, I've only had an amazing cookie. I've heard great things from those around me, though.,Great coffee, friendly people, and the yummiest monkey bread cupcake I've ever eaten. This little coffee shop is just what downtown Mesa needed. It's got a relaxed vibe and the coolest exposed brick walls. Plenty of places to sit and things to read. The baristas are always nice and talkative and make a mean iced latte(no burnt tasting espresso here, unlike that place that starts with an S). 
Great place for people watching, conversation with a friend, and the surfing the interwebs. The iPad cash register is pretty cool too.

The only thing is it can get kinda crazy whenever there is a show at the venue it's attached to. Not too bad inside but lots of teens hanging around outside. Don't be an old fuddy duddy and you'll be fine.,Seriously, the owner, Sam, makes the best traditional macchiato in town. OH, and he's a seriously nice guy too. I did see vegan cupcakes in the display case as well as gluten-free cookies. Win.,This place is awesome! Mesa's downtown is becoming more and more engaging and unique amongst Phoenix's surrounding cities and if you're along this strip for the 2nd Friday art walk or visiting any of the other unique and interesting stores in downtown Mesa be sure to make Lo-Fi THE place to stop in and take a quick break. You'll most likely be served by the owner himself (or a barista under the owners watchful eye) and he is just an awesome dude. Support your local businesses and help grow the AZ economy! 

They are always whipping up a new latest and greatest batch of home-made vegan delicacies and even if you're not into coffee they have a wide range of other drinks and pastries to make the visit well worth it. I stop in every 2nd Friday Art walk I attend and try something new and it's always delicious!,Popped in here because Inside the Bungalow was closed and this was the first coffee shop on Main St. we spotted. It did not disappoint!
It's a very large space with great art and furniture, but was rather empty - given, we went in on a Friday afternoon. I hope they get more business in during the evenings and weekends so it doesn't disappear like so many other local businesses.
The owner was the only one working and was very nice and talkative, you felt very welcome and not looked down on like at some other coffee places. He used a very robust, woodsy coffee for my latte which surprised me - coffee used in mixed drinks usually doesn't stand out so much other than simple coffee flavour. It was very good! There were also plenty of gluten-free and/or vegan baked goods available for those who like that sort of thing. The prices were competitive, too - $3.25 for a 16oz. latte with pumpkin spice flavour added.
If this was closer to my house, I would definitely frequent it. I want to go back and try some of the other coffees and the banana chocolate chip muffins I spotted in the case.,I love lo fi. And not just because I'm friends with the owners and employees! Everyone is seriously amazing, they all go the extra mile to make sure that you're happy! Amazing teas, coffee, and the treats are great. Vegan, and so yummy !,So cool! Great space! Super stylish! Guy who slings the brew really seems passionate about his craft. I'm serious about my Iced Americanos, and Lo-Fi did *not* disappoint!  My only gripe is that they do not have decaf, however the owner did have a good reason.. he just can't seem to find decaf worth serving.. I'm really glad to have something this cool and stylin' in Downtown Mesa... worth a trip just to check it out! :3,Recently, I found myself in downtown Mesa looking for a place to sit an write a while while my son went to a concert - I had 4-5 hours to kill. I planned visiting one of the coffee houses within a 5 mile radius but my lack of familiarity with Mesa made that a disagreeable prospect. Fortunately, I noticed Lo-Fi Coffee, which was literally part of the concert venue building, before I began my trek. Lo-Fi was a comfortable place that served good coffee. But what made me a fan of Lo-Fi was the barista, an Air force vet who was friendly and went out of his way to make me comfortable (they closed at 9 and he let me sit in  until 9:30 - concert lasted until midnight). If I lived closer, or if Lo-Fi opened shop nearer where i live, I would go back again.,This is a nice coffee shop, pretty calm here considering i been here all day and the biggest rush has been 4 people. 

I got the iced coffee / toddy. To be honest the iced coffee was pretty good. Not diluted and not overpowering.  It is a very standard coffee shop layout. It has a good study layout, but the room sound travels too easily and if you are a study in the quiet type person it isn't going to work for you.

To address the price, it is about the same as other places, their prices include tax so that is always nice. You only need quarters when you go here. Very convenient

The staff is chill, definitely a nice place to come by if you live around here. (which i dont)

The only thing which is dumb is the parking time limits, but that is the city's fault.

Why doesn't this place get 5 stars you ask?

They really don't have anything to make this a unique destination, it is just plainly a coffee shop with out a specialty type drink they overly excel at.

I went in and asked if they had a specialty type drink they are known for...i was told the toddy with soy. Needless to say, it was good but didnt blow me away to be a specialty of theirs. 

Nothing special, but a solid place to frequent if you are looking for a standard coffee drink.,fabulous almond milk latte!
the barista was lovely and skilled and intelligent.

and I had a vegan scone that was to die for delicious!!!

go go go!!!,I am all about supporting great local businesses and Lo-Fi didn't disappoint!!! Love when the owner is working and you see him everytime, Sam is a great guy and easy to talk to. Serves I think the best coffee in town. Very cool decor, very relaxing. We love stopping in when we are in the downtown Mesa area and even when we are heading in a  different direction. I am telling you, the Coffee is worth it. Good quality stuff!!!! The prices are very reasonable, I was surprised for such a great cup of coffee.  Keep up the GREAT WORK SAM!!!!,We were downtown Mesa for their annual Fourth of July Celebration.  I found this place on Yelp with good reviews.  When I walked in, it had somewhat a strange smell.  I don't know what to make of it.  Like an old second hand store mixed with coffee.   I was surprised the there were only a couple in there when the rest of the shops and streets were bustling with people.

My little cutie pie ordered a strawberry Italian soda.  The barista, quick thinking, used strawberry puree instead of the usual flavored syrup he didn't have.  I love that he made my son happy as a clam.  My hubby couldn't quite make up his mind and was talked into an espresso macchiato.  I warned him that he never liked espresso.  But, he listened to the barista's raving about how it was the drink that sealed the deal for him to like coffee.  Hubby did not want to hurt the guy's feelings, so he tried it.  I knew he didn't like it when he made the ""bitter beer face"" after each sip.  I had the Americano with cream.  Soy and almond milk are each .50 cents extra.   I love that they use local coffee roaster company.  We didn't try any of the baked goods.  It just didn't look interesting enough.

Would we come back here again?  Maybe.  There are a lot of other coffee places to try on Main Street before I make that decision!,Came here on a chilly night in December and was warmed up by a delicious cappuccino! This place has a really nice atmosphere. My sister got a cup of coffee and I loved the way they brewed it by cup. I want one for home!,Not a good place for studying or chilling out and having conversation.  Wi-fi is unreliable.  Next door neighbor plays heavy metal music so loud that you can't have a conversation or even hear the music that is playing in the coffee shop.",0.325557
It's A Grind Coffee House,"Iced mocha was good. Just good. Not fabulous, but good. And that's really about all I need when I go out and drop $5 on a special coffee.  It's a plus for me if a coffee artist smiles or is kind.  I think the gal who served me was the same person who named the place.  I nearly felt guilty imposing on her.  I'll go Coffee Rush next time because I like to support local.,I have been to It's A Grind far too many times to have not reviewed it yet. Oops!
This place has been my favorite coffee shop in the East Valley for a quick coffee for years. Used to hit the drive thru for a ""nutty cow"" and bagel with cream cheese on my way to early classes or work shifts. They don't mess around with their cream cheese, you get your money's worth. Alas I moved to another part of town and am not as close to them anymore and can't justify driving 10 miles out of my way just to get a coffee. But when in Gilbert, I will stop in whenever I can.
Lately I've rediscovered my love of a good quick coffee from a place that doesn't burn their espresso(desperate times called for desperate measures) and I stumbled upon their little gem called a Rocket Latte. This thing is small but it packs a punch. It tastes like a strong coffee, I get mine with a couple raw sugars, but it is as much caffeine as you could possibly need. 
I have never had a negative customer service experience here. Whether in the drive thru or going in to snag a comfy armchair to do some paperwork or chat with a friend, I have always been greeted with a smile and a great attitude. Keep up the good work guys, you're doing something right.,I hate giving bad reviews, but this place was just ""Meh.""  I always judge a coffee shop by their *OMG* coffee (drip coffee that is).  It's impossible to judge good coffee with all the syrups and sweets people put in them.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good dessert coffee once in awhile.  On this occasion I stopped in during the mid morning and their coffee was really bland.  It isn't as bad as freeze dried...but it's not any better then I can get from Circle K.,Blended mocha is awesome!! Made my Monday. Friendly staff, comfy decor.,Jazzy.  In a mass produced, formulaic kind of way.  Doesn't really go together does it?  Jazz is improvisational in nature, a growing chain of coffeehouses (It's A Grind) is not.

I've been to 2 of these, one closed a few months ago.  They both featured a warm atmosphere, jazz and blues influenced playlists and pop art type pictures of jazz and blues greats.

Looking around in this location I see paintings of Billie, Louie, BB King and SRV.

A coffeehouse could do far worse in searching for a theme.

Coffee is pretty good, service has always been good.

I can live with that.,Just another corporate alternative to Starbucks, but not in any way different. Go one block east to Coffee Rush on Gilbert/Baseline for a much better and cheaper cup of coffee.,I came here to change things up and try a different place.  I really liked the decor inside, and there was plenty of seating.  I can see this place filling up quickly, as seating is plentiful, but not overwhelming.  Plugs are limited, which was frustrating.  

They do have free WiFi service here, as long as you buy a cup of coffee.  They also have outdoor seating and a drive through!  Great hours too.  I think thier open until 8 or 9 at night and open up early as well.

I could see myself returning here on a regular basis!,I came in for free wi-fi (they have it) and coffee.  I got all that along with a breakfast bagel and easy wi-fi access (no codes, no expectation of buying anything), along with a great staff.  All the staff -- ALL of them -- were quick with a smile, they look you in the eyes when they talk to you and are just generally awesome.  I love this place.  Oh, and nice jazzy atmosphere.  On this morning, they're playing a jazzy Christmas medley.,One of the reasons I love It's A Grind is because they are very VERY comparative to Starbucks. I do love me some S-Bux but the pricing and the lack of free wi-fi have prompted me to look elsewhere for a coffee house experience.

I would definitely give It's A Grind another star if they were open later and their specialty drinks weren't extremely overpriced.  A half coffee/half milk blended drink (small size) is $5?! Well, with that said... this is a MUCH better alternative to Coffee Rush because, well, I'll write about them in their review section...

Staff is very friendly, atmosphere is comfortable, and usually I can focus well when I need to study or write a paper. Drinks are GREAT and they even offer a regular black tea: my favorite since I'm not a real avid coffee drinker! Plus it's close to the shopping center and they offer great little snacks to go with your drink. I can't recommend it enough. Go now!,Far better latte than bucks-thats for sure.  This is a place I meet my friend for coffee when she drives down from scottsdale.  we always have a wonderful drink-peppermint latte for me- and some great conversation.  Even though I live about 5 miles from It's a Grind, I do not go there just for a coffee, I guess if it was on my way to work or more conveneintly located I would because although the prices are similar to bucks it is far far better tasting and just a not so franchised look...,I've been into this shop a couple times, and have always had a good experience.  This past weekend, we were up for a early bike ride and thought we'd grab an iced coffee on our way.  Unfortunately we were disappointed to find they do not open until 8am on Sundays.

That being said, the girls inside opened the door and welcomed me in at 7:40.  In the midst of getting ready to open they prepared me a couple coffees to go and helped another couple there early as well.  Great customer service!  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  The barista asked what I wanted my coffee like, and nailed it!  Decor inside is cute and looks like a cozy place to go read once it cools down.  Good music is another plus ;)

Coffee is a little on the spendy side, but then again, you get what you pay for.  No over roasted beans here people.  Docked a star due to lack of early hours on the weekend, but service and coffee are superb.  Might have to grab a scone next time as they looked phenomenal!,Hurry in and try this Ginger Cinnamon Latte!! I added carmel sauce and soy milk over ice in their large, a whopping 32oz size, Delish!! The flavor combination was amazing! I would drive out of my way any day for this place. 

Tucked behind Fox and Hound Pub & Grill this coffee shop is small, but warm and inviting. The staff was very helpful and friendly, my barista even asked me to try this unusual concoction, upon pickup, to make sure I liked it. I was in love! I may have found my new coffee stop. 

Comparable to *bucks pricing but has a much truer taste without the burnt espresso taste = worth it! They also have a convenient drive up window. (Yay! now I can pickup this coffee goodness in my pjs!),This place has a wonderful atmosphere including great music.  The servers are friendly and the drive through is quick.  I like the coffee better than the big chains and they have very good pastries.  This is a great place to relax or even have a first date.,I'm not a coffee drinker... in fact, the taste and smell used to make me gag! I'm broadening my palate and It's A Grind sold me the first cup of coffee I've ever purchased that wasn't for someone else! It was mixed and iced... but I was pleased. :-),I have been frequenting this spot since they opened and have always said they were better than Starbucks but Iam in a special kind of heaven after the change in menu and addition of pressed tea lattes!!! Yum, yum, yum!!! Far better than Starbucks powdered green tea latte and roughly a dollar cheaper than the high priced cup there as well. The early morning staff is great and free WiFi is an added bonus. I can honestly say for the New Year, I'm quitting you Starbucks......and mean it.,Absolutely love this place! One of my favorite coffee shops. The people who work here are so friendly, helpful, and make you feel like you are at home. The drinks are very delicious. I love their tea latte that is pressed. They use actual tea leaves and after a few minutes add some love such as real vanilla to make the ends result absolutely wonderful. Best chai tea I have ever had! The chairs are very comfortable too. I can sit in them all day. This is a great spot for some family time, to chill, and to study. They even have a drive through.,Pleasant unexpected find!  What a great little place.  Perfect for studying or catching up with friends.  Nice comfy chairs, tables, electrical outlets, and free wi-fi make this a nice place to study.  Though I don't drink coffee, I did enjoy the shaken iced tea.   It is a small venue so there is the potential to get crowded, however, crowding was not a problem for us while we were there.  The other patrons were doing their own things, studying, reading, have quiet conversation and the music played in the store was at a good volume - pleasant, but not overwhelming.  Also the temperature inside was nice, not too cold like some other coffee houses.  This may very well be me new favorite study spot.,having had too much starbucks for too long in my travels, i found it's a grind to be pretty unique. good experience with good natured employees; most importantly, interesting offering of different strengths of coffee.  coffee was commendable, comparable to starbucks, but a notch below peet's coffee.",0.293321
Hava Java,"This place as a whole has bitter sweet memories for me, it was the beginning and the end of a very important and romantic relationship in my life.
The atmosphere is so great, it is housed next to a gelato place and the two go great together. On weekend evenings in summer, they would have live music, not sur eif they stil do.
The outside seating in the area is condusive to some great people watching. The coffee, hot or iced, is fantastic. If you are in the area, I highly recommend going!,Nice place to have a cool drink on a hot day. They have a variety of yummy tea flavors that you can opt to have sweetened if you have a sweet tooth like me. Since I needed an extra boost after spending the afternoon at the Scottsdale Culinary Food Festival, I opted for the sugar free English toffee latte with an extra shot off espresso. Boy was it yummy! 

Thanks Yelp for leading the way!!!,The non-fat mocha I had was just ok.Couldn't taste the espreso.  A lot of people pass through making it good for people watching, but tables are too close together to be comfortable.,Lots of different types of hava teas, different flavors and caffeinated/non-caffeinated types. Great sitting area and there is also wireless.,Just wonderful! I love the coffee here. The atmosphere is war and friendly. A lot of friendly people hanging out.,I met a friend here for coffee a few weeks ago and really liked it! 

I had a mocha java that was really good, maybe the best mocha I've ever had, in fact.  The price was around $4, pretty comparable to most coffee shops. The gals behind the counter were exceptionally friendly. 

The inside was a bit small, but it was a beautiful day to enjoy the weather on the spacious patio. There seemed to be quite a few business folks inside on laptops though, so it'd probably be a great spot to get some out of office work done. 

It gets a 4 star for now because I've only tried one item, but next time I'm down that way, I will certainly try it again.,I give this place 4 and a half stars...I have been going to this place for years since I first moved to Arizona.  My mom used to bring my sister and I here to get Italian sodas with cream...the raspberry one was always my favorite!  I have tried the chai but it is not my favorite, but it is still very good!  This place is right next to the gelato spot so it makes it that much better!  This place is cute and the staff is so nice and friendly!  I will only get italian sodas from this place...no other coffee shops make theirs like them.  They are the best!  Too bad they are not so good for you!  I hope this place is around forever they deserve it!,I've been to the Gelato Spot next-door countless times, but for some reason I never stepped in here.

I have been missing out!!

When I walked in at 2pm, all the tables were full but there was no line at the counter. The cheerful barista asked what she could get for me and when I said I wasn't sure, she not only told me to take my time, but pulled out laminated sheets listing their syrups and teas. That intuitive customer service set things off right from the get-go. I noticed they had one of my favorite (yet hard to come-by) flavors- praline, and ordered a decaf iced praline latte. The barista made the drink quickly, in spite of her accidental initial pull of regular espresso, which she noticed right away and fixed. She also asked my milk preference which I liked because let's face it girls, some days are skim days and others are 2% days and it helps to have someone remind me of that. :)

The latte was satisfying. It wasn't mind-blowing, but it was made well and wasn't overwhelmingly sweet like the lattes they usually serve at Starbucks (this coming from a sugar fanatic!). The pitcher of water and water cups they have out with the cream and sugar is a nice touch that I'd like to see in every coffee shop. 

The decor is sort of rustic with burlap coffee sacks above the door and local art on the walls. The atmosphere, which can't really be pinned down to one thing, is welcoming and relaxed and I felt like I could hide away for hours there. 

There were a few negatives. The first was the mess of a baked goods display. I'm sure it looked great at opening, but by the time I was there, it was disheveled, half empty and didn't look like it had been tidied up all day. Typically I ignore the food offerings at coffee-shops, but I skipped lunch today and could have been persuaded to drop a few dollars if I'd seen anything remotely interesting. The other thing is that they have a drink refrigerator containing water bottles, juices and other bottled drinks for sale. It's so loud!! It cycles on and off, but when it's on, it can be pretty distracting. 

I will definitely come back to this place, especially as the weather improves and all the outdoor seating becomes a viable option. Now I just need to silence those evil thoughts that tell me it's acceptable to get a gelato within the same hour as getting a sugary latte...,One word for my late: Water.  Not really sure what went wrong.  On the other hand, right next to the Gelato Spot, which is worth something...,Love Love Love a Hava Java! Their coffee is so good and it is always such a treat to enjoy a latte with my favorite girls! By far my favorite coffee in AZ!

The staff is super friendly and it is a great neighborhood atmosphere! Also, love the punch cards especially when I get a free one!!

Can't say enough good things about Hava!,I work right next to Hava Java, and thank the lord for that. I cry on my days off when I can't have my delicious special order mocha that Lance the barista always gets spot on. 

the crew is always friendly and super fast (one of my pet peeves is super slow coffee service... ) and even if I stray from my usual and get something new or seasonal, I am never left unhappy. Megan, Season and Jake are on the regular crew and make the experience stellar. 

The customers also make this spot cool... it's nice to see everyone slow down and relax with a yummy cup o' joe. My heart belongs to Hava Java!,Nice little corner place to grab a cup of coffee and have a morning meeting...  Can sit inside or out.  I'm not big on the specialty coffees, so I only go to the outside spot, but the coffee was pretty good.,WARNING:   If you are a lady of a certain age, you will not be happy with the weekend barista.     Don't know her name...she is short and has dark hair (not the delightful Meghan who is at the counter on weekdays).      This lady is never friendly, but yesterday was over-the-top nasty.    

I asked for an iced tea and wanted to add ""light ice"".    She turned her back on me before I could finish my sentence.    When I called after her to finish the order her response was:

""I don't care.""

And after that, it got really ugly.     Among her other ""gems"" was the utterance that she has been making coffee etc for 7 years and I have no right to question her.     Hello!    It was my drink...and it was hardly a difficult request.    

I am a regular at Hava Java.    Most of the staff there are stellar...really fun to talk to.   This one is very, very opposite.  

 I stopped in at a nearby clothing store and muttered about this to the saleslady, who is also a frequent customer and who is also a ""lady of a certain age.""     She told me that she has had the same experience...and only with this ""little dark haired weekend girl.""    

I suspect if you're a hunky guy and might be a great Saturday night date, you will get decent service from this one barista.      But if you are anything else....watch out!    This one barista will make your Hava Java experience miserable.,Had to update...I have now had the espresso and feel I can go the full 5 on Hava... went in for a nonfat latte... perfecto... The girl at the counter was just as nice and sweet as the guy last week... and I like that patio tables outside.. I cant knock the place for where its located.. that has nothing to do with the service or java or quality...so therefore, I wont:-) froth me hava... and if Im giving 5stars... i love you!,Great coffee and muffins. I have been a patron for years!,Great coffee and friendly people makes for a 5 star experience,It was okay...The lady behind the counter was very nice but the ""Big Choco Chip Cookie"" was boing.
Not much in the way on ambiance,not someplace I'd find myself just relaxing for a bit,but was okay to stop in on my way to elsewhere.,Reliable wireless internet is hard to come by. But great wireless that is FREE, plus plenty of outlets, enough seating, cozy atmosphere and good coffee? Too good to be true. 

The coffee is cheaper than Starbucks, with bigger containers. It's relatively quiet, yet crowded -- the laptop crowd have definitely  discovered this gem. 

Even better, there is a big open sliding glass door that connects Hava Java to The Gelato Spot -- a truly delicious place with tons of great flavors! So you can enjoy a bit of gelato if you get bored with coffee. 

As someone who works from coffee shops a lot, this place really caters to people with laptops -- and most coffee shops don't. 

I'd recommend this to anyone.,IF YOU LIKE TO OVERPAY FOR WATERED DOWN COFFEE, SERVICE WITH AN ATTITUDE, & GET STALE PASTRY WITH FLIES FLYING INSIDE THE BAKERY CASE THAN THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU! BTW: THERE IS A 50 CENT CHARGE TO USE YOUR CREDIT/DEBIT CARD TO PAY FOR YOUR COFFEE HERE (WTF!)
 
I hate to write a negative review for a place that use to be an old neighborhood favorite.  But if your loyal customers just stop showing up & never criticize your performance you can 't FIX IT! 

So here's my father's words of wisdom that you won't get in any business school: 
""People go where they are invited, they stay where they feel welcomed!""

Hava java stopped inviting & welcoming customers when it started putting offensive signs on the bathroom door, and then password protecting its free WiFi service with passwords like BUY COFFEE! It seems that Hava Java lost the hunger to be a superior establishment by having better tasting products at a competitive price, and giving their customers a better experience than their competitors!

Hava Java  use to be a great place to hang out or for a cup of coffee in the Arcadia/Camelback area, but it seems in the past couple of years the place has consistently slipped and it is sharing the faith of another once upon a time great coffee hang out at the Biltmore area, The Coffee Plantation!,Great!,I've spending a lot of time with a friend who is a pretty serious coffee drinker.  A couple nights ago, we stopped in at Hava Java for a caffeinated beverage before enjoying some gelato next door.  Being the afternoon of July 4th, the place was empty, save for the barista and a guy who was in there chatting her up.  I ordered a cafe au lait, he an iced coffee of some sort.  After asking me if I preferred skim milk or 2%, the barista handed me my cup of milk and foam and told me the coffee was self-serve and pointed me in the direction of the three coffee dispensers on the other side of the bar.  Really?  $3.75 for a cafe au lait and I have to pour the coffee myself?  I suppose that wouldn't have been entirely terrible if it had been any good.  It's amazing how much difference whole milk makes, but even beyond that, the coffee was weak and flavorless, and since it had to be pumped over the weak foam and milk, my drink tasted like little more than a drip coffee with milk.  Lame.  Sorry, Hava Java - a repeat customer I will not become.

P.S. - A $0.25 ""service fee"" is charged to all credit/debit transactions.  Again, lame.,good place to kill an evening. I used to spend my time here many moons ago. good coffee at good prices.,I have only had the tea that Hava Java offers but must say that it is quite possibly the best tea I have received from any local cafe. When I had the flu I could only think of having the cinnamon apple tea. The greeting by the staff is always prompt and friendly making any wait for a beverage worth it. There is limited seating so having meetings can be a bit of a challenge here.,What a sweet aroma! As soon as you walk in you are immersed in the delicious smell of coffee. It makes me sigh with relief that my caffeine addiction will be tempered with some tasty Java and a muffin. Thank you Hava Java!,I really like Hava Java! They have a great location (32nd and Camelback) and are located right next to The Gelato Spot, which has amazing Gelato. They actually share a common wall.

Hava Java itself is pretty small inside, but there is outdoor seating in the front and in the back. 

They make really good coffee's. I especially enjoy their vanilla latte. I think they have a punch-card system and they have very reasonable prices, as well. 

Only reason I did not give them 5 stars is because they have a surcharge for you to use your credit/debit card and I know that is against Visa and MasterCard regulations.,A cozy place for having good coffee while relaxing or even doing some online browsing, as evidenced by patrons taking advantage of the WiFi. Friendly baristas, outdoor seating, opening  into The Gelato Spot, and being next to some cool restaurants and shops (including Fresh Vitamins, my new favorite vitamin place) make this coffee house a winner.,This is the place I go if I want to sit and have a coffee in the morning.  It's close to home so it's convenient.  I love that people often bring their dogs on weekends as they sit outside and sip their cup of java.,I work across the street and love me some Hava Java. The morning crew is very friendly, and the coffee is great. I am a big fan of the Swiss chocolate blend, (or any of the flavored blends for that matter!) they are really flavorful without tasting at all artificial. I buy Hava Java beans and brew them at home, but when I stop in for a quick cup of coffee I always have a good experience.,Really good coffee and friendly staff. My only complaint being a person that likes to just hang out and read at coffee shops is the lack of comfortable seats.,I think Hava Java is nasty. Their drinks are soo bitter. Yuck!,What sets Hava Java apart from the rest of the coffee shops in town is the amazing service you'll get there.  I recently returned to Phoenix after spending a few years in Oregon and when I stopped into Hava Java, not only did I recognize the barista behind the counter, but she recognized me, too.  That is pretty impressive after a couple years.  After talking with her for a while, it turns out that the owner takes really good care of his employees (full benefits, etc.) and they have very little turnover there.  She said that they have only lost one person since I have been away.  That is impressive for a coffee shop.  

Their espresso is pretty good and according to my wife, their tea is the best she's had in town.  It is the best place for coffee that I know of in the area.,I have been here a few times. The coffee is definitely a notch above decent, which is rare, and they have a great selection of teas.

The space is narrow and long, which always reminds me of NYC businesses. Only... this place doesn't seem to have a ""vibe"" to it, at least none that I can discern. It's a great place if you need some wifi and coffee in the neighborhood, or are going to BYOC (bring your own company). Hava Java gets the job done.,Best place in Arcadia to get a coffee or a tea. Lots of friendly locals and great place to sit outside to people watch and read the paper in the morning early lunchtime.,Blah, worst coffee ever. Had this place 2 weeks ago and I will never come back. Their drip coffee tasted watered down, overpriced and it was by far the shittiest coffee I have ever had. I would much rather get my coffee from AM/PM then ever walk into this place again. Horrible.,There are a few things that really can annoy a great man, and that is making me pay for a credit card fee.  I understand that you have to deal with some points on your transactions, but hey that is business and if you feel that this was hitting your bottom line I would suggest you re-evaluate your strategy on pricing. The coffee, meh it was okay but I have experienced way better, please re-consider your 25 cent credit card charge, it's tacky.,People. People. Some of you negative nancys need to take a deep breath and stop complaining about getting charged 25 cents for using your credit card. Yelp reviews can make or break these local businesses, and small things like processing fees aren't a true representation of what a coffee shop experience should be about. Hava Java is a great independent coffee shop with great tasting coffee and tea. The baristas are on-point and very friendly. For the price you pay, you get a great beverage, and it doesn't taste anything like strbx. The 1 negative of this place is the lack of seating- it is a 'run and gun' coffee bar- and if I want to stay and read or do work, I go to Lux. Maybe make the outdoor seating more compact and expansive? I want more independent local businesses like Hava Java in my neighborhood, and I'm willing to pay a little extra for that- but they do give punch cards here so it all evens out and then some!,Love Hava Java. They have the BEST coffee!!! The staff is so nice too.,Stopped in after enjoying some gelato next door. Immediately I felt like I wasn't in Phoenix at all, but Olympia.. except the whole local-coffee-shop thing was done better at Hava Java. Dim lighting and the slim layout keep it cozy, and there are tables outside as well.
I didn't have the coffee, but ordered an italian soda and FOR ONCE it was made the proper way: fizzy, not loaded with half and half, and hardly sweet. Very refreshing!
Also I should add our barista was pretty cute.. a cafe is ten times better when you have some eye-candy in there.
I'll review it again after I have the coffee and sit and enjoy it a bit.. until then though, it doesn't feel fair to get five stars.,My super favorite place for iced teas in the valley. I say this because the teas are loose-leaf and brewed when ordered. There is no packets of tea lying around. 

Also I get a large32oz  pomegranate-green iced tea for only $2.50 compared to that one well know ""coffee"" place where I can't even get a Venti for that price.,Love the coffee, beautifully roasted and smooth. My favorite is the Vienna Roast...Jake and the morning staff are always friendly. I also love their lattes, make them just right!!They have a good selection of pastries to accompany any of their fabulous drinks. Although the inside is a little small they have a nice patio area, great place to watch people and is dog friendly!,UPDATE 2/8/06

Well, I had to take a star off because the Spanish Latte at LGO (Le Grande Orange) seriously kicks ass.  I hate to say it, but Hava Java just can't hold a candle to it.  But I still really like Hava Java for coffee and it is a nice place to sit.  It also had the bonus of being connected to a genuine gelatoria.


++++++++++++++

The best coffee I have had in Phoenix.  I wouldn't give it 5 stars in the greater coffee universe, but it is way better than what you will find at Starbucks or Coffee Plantation (which hardly qualifies as coffee in my book).  Until I find better in Phoenix/Scottsdale I will let the rating stand.  Bonus points for being connected to a gelato shop.  Baked goods/pasteries are average.  Pleasant atmosphere.,Yep Yelpers - I'm not ever going back here again. 

I asked the girl at the counter if they had Iced Toddy. Nope...no big deal. I asked instead for iced coffee with two shots of espresso in it. She said sure, no problem. 

What she handed me was A CUP OF ICE with two BITTER, BITTER, BITTER shots of espresso in the bottom. (That's not me being hyperbolic. I came home and made everyone in the house try the most bitter coffee concoction I've ever come across.) Okay so then she sent me over to the bar to the hot coffee. Melted my ice and my plastic cup. Not exactly what I meant when I asked if they had iced coffee... 

How much did this crud cost me?? A whooping $2.75. Oh, but wait! It's actually $3.00, an extra 25 cents for running it on my card, which she tells me AS SHE SWIPES MY CARD. I had cash on me. And I really would have preferred to be offered a choice to use it ahead of time. 

Also, their seating consists mostly of a long bar against the wall opposite of the coffee counter. You wouldn't be able to camp out here with a laptop, homework, or even a book. There just isn't any room. There's a few tables, but if a group walked in you'd have a major guilt trip. 

All in all, you'd go to Hava Java for a run and go coffee. And frankly, I never want to put that stuff in my mouth again. I don't see what this place has to offer.,Hava Java will be missed by the naked eye barreling along Camelback, but I'm here to tell you that it's there. It's there to bring you fresh coffee and pastries and wifi, like most coffee houses do these days. The coffee is not too bad. Good place to meet someone on a coffee date, but the parking's a bit awkward since it's in another one of Phoenix's famous strip malls. The seating inside is a bit weird, so sitting outside next to the parking lot is a good choice as well. 

I'm still confused on the pronunciation of the name. Is it ""hov-vah jov-vah"" or is it a short ""a"" sound, for examples, as in the word ""fashion""? Either way, you're pronouncing one of the words incorrectly, and that just bothers me. C- for grammar.,Jake and Season are always there to greet you with a smile and the best iced latte in town. No wonder they win all the coffee awards!,This has been a favorite spot for me since moving to the area a few months ago. Always order one of the green iced teas and I love how they make it just for me. Have stayed for hours inside and out (working on laptop) & never felt pressed to leave, Clients are a nice mix and seem to take their cue from the owner: gracious.,I was meeting a friend to get Gelato and instead I wanted a latte to check this place out. They have great lattes! The coffee wasn't bitter and very smooth. The place is a smaller intimate place, but I do enjoy the outdoor seating! Make sure you have cash because they do charge .25$ for CC's. I'll be coming back for sure!,Come for the average joe, stay for the awesome service, get stuck catching up with everyone you've ever met who lives in the area.,The cup reads, ""Arizona's Most Awarded Coffee House Since 1992."" 

My, what lofty praise, I think. Is this place really the best? Hmmm. 

After forking over $2.75 for a double shot of espresso, I made my way to the coffee bar where there was cold skim milk, plenty of sugar packs and a variety of flavor-adds, like cocoa. Then, I took my first sip. Yum. Of course, can you really mess up a double shot of espresso? God, I hope not. 

In any case, this place is ""nifty."" I use that word because it's situated next door to The Gelato Spot and is a bit crammed for space. A splattering of like 4 people at the tables near the door made this place look a bit too crowded to me. Then again, if I had been at one of those tables, I probably wouldn't have noticed, or even cared. 

The girl behind the counter was very friendly. I appreciated that. It's not often I joke around with baristas. She managed to make me laugh, too. To me, that's sweeter than an extra pack of Splenda. 

Hava Java is a great location. I wondered over here after stuffing my belly full of wonderful sushi at Zen 32. My cohorts were immediately pulled into The Gelato Spot while I ordered my beverage. 66% of 'em wound up with gelato. Having already ordered and flavored my double to taste, I went hunting for them. That's where I found 2 of them cozied up to gelato and another teasing herself with the idea. I sampled a couple, but was very content with my coffee. So, if you plan to drop by Hava Java, just make sure you walk right up to the counter and order, or you may be sucked next door where you'll succumb to your sweet tooth. 

Then again, if gelato isn't your thing, I did see ridiciously huge muffins and bagels on display at Hava Java. They looked ridiciously delicious. I don't know why anyone would need a muffin the size of King Kong's fist. But, then again, I couldn't resist the after-lunch pick-me-up that Hava Java delivered. 

By the way, did somebody say free wi-fi? Uhm, yeah. That makes it all the more worth it!,In a world of Starbucks, this is a rare gem.  The espresso beans are awesome & they will sell you some to take home.  I don't really go for flavored beans, but they have those too.  They have a big selection of baked goods and the scones are buttery and amazing.  They have a great selection of teas & brew every cup fresh.  The pomegranate green tea is awesome. I love that they still have punch cards to get your 10th drink free (any way you want it).,I loved the free wi-fi...but the coffee was just ok.  Wish that they would switch to a different brand of soy milk since the Silk soy has a pretty strong flavor profile.,In love with the Chai currently...hot, iced, whatever, just give me a Hava Java Chai!!!! Speed of service is great. Baristas are friendly and easy going.,Hava Java is a great place to go if you're looking to quickly grab something to go or even if you are looking for a fun place to hang out. The staff is always very nice and work efficiently! I always get an Americano which has great flavor. 

Love the atmosphere - especially when the weather permits openings the sliding doors in the front.,Hava Java is a really nicely located locally owned coffee shop that makes superb coffee and coffee drinks, provides great pastries and bagels, and is staffed by friendly helpful good looking staff. They would get 5 stars but for one older guy who is behind the counter once in a while changing trash bags -possibly the owner or manager. This guy is rude unless he knows you (he's friendly to some of the customers he knows by name) and aggressively arrogant to me each time I'm in there and I swear I have never ever even met him! Did I say something? I said good morning to him one morning while he was behind the counter and he said ""I don't work here"" as if I had asked him to go clean something brown from my son's diaper. You were behind the counter changing a trash can liner and you don't work there? And what's wrong with good morning no matter your employment status? Not sure about the reason for his attitude, very strange, but I'm glad the baristas are friendly. Love to go there with friends and on my way to work, and especially as a Sat morning hangout with my 14 month old. Get a life you grouch, and get out of the way of all the friendly people who work there.,A great place to have a quality cup of coffee at a reasonable price.   The location is key - 32nd and Camelback Road.  

There is plenty of magazines and newspapers for reading alongside wifi to do your work.  A great combination to let you sit, relax and enjoy life.

The space is limited and often times feels cramped.  It can be a chore to use the restroom.

The over ambiance is a winner and is worth the visit.,I have always liked Hava Java.  Good coffee, great mocha's too.  But It used to be better.  Ever since the Gelato spot opened up, it is much busier and nosier making it not so good for study if that is what you need.  

Completely packed in the morning too, long lines.  Lance has been a Barista there forever, very nice guy.  Really nice bagels too...cruncy when toasted.  Recommended.,A neighborhood favorite.  You can always count on excellent up beat service from Jake & Season and their brew crew any time of day.  Their service alone makes me a returning customer.  Be sure to try to the freshly brewed iced teas, yummy lattes and tasty Bialys.  A good place to get quick great service and hang out in their patio with friends or to meet new ones.  Very cool coffee shop.,The BF and I went here tonight as part of the Coffee Tour of Phx FTW! We had just eaten at Delux and came here 5 minutes before they closed (I know.... we felt like jerks). The girl who worked there was nice, though, and made us coffee without being too angry. Ok... these lattes were good! Like... Very good! I'm happy we were jerks and went in here right before they closed because now I know of another good coffee place in Phoenix... which is more of a rarity than you'd think. Go get a hot latte and be happy!,I'm a coffee snob & I have to say this place is really good.  I drink americanos and the quality is excellent -- not too burnt but still has good flavor.  In addition, it's hot.....very hot....which is the way is should be.  I like it better than Starbucks.

Worth trying,i like this place! the workers are always friendly and it's great that it's connected to the gelato spot. the only reason my rating is limited to a three is the quality of their coffee. they don't seem to know the particularities of traditional espresso. unsatisfactory for a macchiato, but if you're going for something sweet like an iced mocha you probably wouldn't be disappointed at all.,Love the coffee, beautifully roasted and never bitter. I suggest the Vienna Roast...morning staff is always incredibly friendly. Good pastries. Although the inside is a little small they have a nice patio area, great place to watch people and all their fancy purebred dogs.",0.328772
Grinders Coffee Company,"a nice place. kind of amateur service, but i'm sure with experience they'll improve by leaps and bounds. mediocre espresso and milk, but a nice atmosphere. i wouldn't make the drive if you're not already in the neighborhood, but i'm sure it's an asset to the area nevertheless.,I have to say it's a relief to not have to head south for some good espresso but this may be too far north...not sure. Their espresso is locally roasted and smooth so they automatically go into my top five. I also like the fact that the crowd is decidedly not the coffee snob crowd you'll find in venues further south. That being said, on my first visit the crowd was more the Sunnyslope crowd so I didn't know what to make of everything.

All that said, the coffee is good and I really liked the choices on their menu and they are all about local business. If I can come here and get a good Americano without having to wait in a long line I think I'm sold!,Just got in from a great evening at Grinders! Who knew you could hear amazing blues music for free -- in Sunnyslope of all places -- on the 2nd Saturday of each month!? I did, actually. The real question is why don't I go every month!?

So, now I'm hopped up on a dirty chai latte and I must share the details about this neighborhood gem. Truly, the Valley's BEST neighborhood coffee shop! For a number of reasons...

1.) Grinders is a place where everyone feels welcome from high school kids to retirees taking advantage of the free wi-fi.

2.) They roast their OWN beans. That's right. They wheel a roaster out onto the same concrete slab that becomes the stage for Valley blues legends like Ronnie Whitehead on 2nd Saturdays and roast the beans for themselves!! I find their coffees to be pretty earthy and smooth. 

3.) The fudgy pecan brownies are rich and chocolaty. The scones are biscuit-like and just the right amount of barely sweet. (I haven't tried the danish, but they look deadly!)

4.) They are generous in sharing their own talents and promoting the talents of others, ensuring access to arts and culture. Each month, they allow a different local artist to show their work on the coffee shop walls. And while ordinarily they are not open past 6 p.m. on Saturday, an exception is made on the 2nd Saturday of each month when you can sit outside and listen to  live jazz and/or blues from 8 - 10 p.m.  And, by the way, Dennis, the owner, is a bad ass on the harmonica! 

We really are so lucky to have such a great business, doing great things, in the community!,I am a bone-fide coffee snob. I hate Starbucks, so when I moved two blocks south of Grinders, I was giddily giggling all the way to the register... Not literally, 'cause people would stare.
However, it has been nearly a year and the only coffee item I have tried is the Viennese. Am I really just a creature of habit, or is this coffee filled with nicotine? It's delicious, anyway. Get it! 

I like the names of their sizes, it's cute and I take it as a jab at Starbucks, which pleases me immensely. The atmosphere is very ""living room"", with local art they sell to customers, comfy couches, and tables that have seen lots of use. Their patio is getting nicer now that it's cooling off, and usually the baristas if they aren't too busy will walk your coffee or drink of choice out to you. 
They roast their own beans, and sell them to you in cute little paper bags! Mum loves the Heavenly Bliss, it's not too acidic like some roasts are, and has an amazing aroma when it's going through the coffee machine, plus it isn't too pricey for in-house roasted beans, which can often get expensive.
I live close enough to hear their live bands play when I'm out and about, and they're usually good falling in to the Blues category, A few friends say it's definitely worth the trip over there to check it out!,Cute little coffee shop. Had some tea and sat outside with my boyfriend. Enjoyed the weather and played some cards. Very relaxing.,I popped into Grinders yesterday afternoon (a bit after lunch time) for a pick-me-up.  I just love this neighborhood gem.  There's a nice comfy vibe and the staff is welcoming and accomodating.  They patiently fielded my questions about available sugar-free syrup options and happily indulged my request for a combination of syrups for my iced latte.  It was fantastic!

I've recently been informed that they host blues music on the 2nd Saturday evening of each month.  I can't wait to check it out next month.,There are so many great things about Grinders!  Rotating Art from local artists (and not the ones trying their hardest to win the next hipster award), live music with great jazz bands, excellent coffee and tea reasonably priced. The fourth star is awarded for the pecan/cream cheese Danish thing the server recommended. It was so good I couldn't decide weather to scarf it down or savor each bite.,I generally brew my own coffee at home, and if not, I usually end up at the St*rb*cks drive-thru, but when I have time to walk down the street for coffee, this is where I end up.  Excellent house roast, roasted on premises, good people behind the counter.  I enjoy the croissants, flaky and light (like me!), but haven't tried any of the other 'home-made' pastries they have available.

Better then your corporate coffee, made by real people.,I needed a caffeine fix, and love to support and try out local/family-owned businesses.  Found this place not too far from where my hotel was and thought I'd give it a shot.  Overall it's a cute little cafe with friendly service.  I don't like my coffee too sweet (unless it's Vietnamese iced coffee...that's a category all on it's own!), so I talked to the barista for awhile to get the right drink.  He was super nice and ended up customizing a drink for me, which I really appreciated, but the drink still ended up way too sweet for my liking.

I would consider going back to give it another shot the next time I'm in town.,Some of the best coffee I've ever had -- and I lived in Portland. Insanely good selection & product. Tanzanian peaberry off the charts. Owner gets beans from multiple sources to ensure that his selection is the best.,The staff is very friendly and they bring your drinks out to you.  The artwork and jewelry by local artists is usually quite good, and something I'd consider buying if I had the spare money.

Their coffee has a great taste, much better than Starbucks, and I like putting money into small businesses instead of the Wal-Marts of the coffee world.  They make my finicky customized orders with no issue and I always prefer to visit them rather than a Starbucks, but I have to hold a star back due to their pretty limited hours.  They close especially early on Sundays considering their line of business, so sometimes I end up having to hit the Starbucks anyway. :(,I think I'm spoiled by the number of solid coffee shops in the Tempe area.  Grinders is the best coffee shop that is on my very direct path to work, but if any of my usual hotspots were equally as convenient, I'd head to them instead.

Pros - The coffee is pretty good, it's locally owned, there are recurrent characters every morning no matter what, and their support of other local business and artists is commendable.  

Cons - For some reason I never get a very friendly vibe when I'm there, the facility is kind of small and I feel like it lacks character, and...it just lacks that little extra.

We'll see, maybe I'm tarnished by the fact that I stop in here before work every morning and it's ME that isn't in a friendly mood.  Then I just thought about my review for D-Lish in Scottsdale....,I was going for a long bike ride from Glendale, but did not quite make it to Lux before freaking out about how little homework I had accomplished. I spied Grinders on my phone, and went in this direction. Around 3p the place was swarming with teens, it seems like they graciously give the kids free water. Although many hard surfaces mean it can be a little loud with just a few people, I like the vibe. It also feels good to support  a place that gives much back to the community----from fresh roasted coffee beans to display space for local artists to music. Grinders is not about the hardware---but the software.,I really liked this place. It was kind of kooky, full of art and all sorts of odds and ends. The staff was great. Very friendly. They roast their own beans and have selections from different parts of the earth. My latte was just what I needed. Love quirky little places like this. They make me feel like I belong somewhere :),I've NEVER been happy to pay more than $4 for a 'grande'-sized latte... until I tried this place. It's on my way to the office, and I decided to give it a try. As already noted by other Yelpers, this place roasts its own beans, on site. I got a vanilla latte and wow... this is not Starbucks. This was a cuppa POW, right in the kisser. Loved it! You should check it out. =),Grinder's is a great little coffee shop in the Sunnyslope district.  Each week I purchase my two pounds of coffee that has been roasted in their shop (the roaster is part of the decor).  The staff is always friendly and lets me know what is the best roast that week.  Since my tastes change, sometimes going for the super dark roast or perhaps a lighter flavor the next week, they help me pick out the best bean.
This little shop is full of locals and in the afternoon, be prepared for the Sunnyslope High School crowd.  The staff is sometimes a bit slow getting out orders, but they make up for it with friendly service and a great product. Another place where they get to know their customers by their names!,Great place!  I have been coming here after morning runs for years.  Coffee is always fresh, and they usually have a wonderful assortment of baked goods if you need something sweet.  The crowd is always friendly, and the service is stellar.,Refugees from the 60's. The owner from Grinders own band puts on a hell of a show. Rock 'n roll and blues cover, the guys are damn good. Eric Claption, Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughn just to name a few. The Sunnyslope Art Walk this evening was super fun sitting on their sofa.

I enjoyed the white chocolate cafe mocha and for the first time Grinders was offering sandwiches at $6.50. I ordered the club and it was excellent. The gals are always very pleasant. The couple of artist doing work in the store were very talented. I liked the Marilyn and Red Sun on canvas.,Man, I'm loving this place. I've gone here almost everyday this week because it is in between my apartment and my school. I've loved every second I've been in there. The coffee is awesome, the staff is even better. The music is always playing (with good tunes, mind you) I even have had random conversations with people. I will be here every time I need to get out of the house and work. Grinder's wins in my book.,This place knows coffee.... not that over roasted thin tasting stuff you get at that popular chain either.  They know the science of getting the best out of the bean.

The beans here are roasted on the premises, on Monday and Wednesday morning. In my opinion, the owner, is an artist in coffee roasting.  He keeps a delectable assortment of coffees at a very good price.... they also have pastries and light dining.

Plenty of parking.  Located on the southeast corner of Central and Dunlap.  The coffee is great, the seating is comfortable and the people are very nice.

They have added a website:

http://www.grinderscoffeeco.com/,The place is small but, I see it as cozy. There is also outside seating that is great to enjoy on a beautiful day or evening. 

The owner waited on me. And made me the best Viennese Mocha, I 
think is possible. Excellent to the last drop! I learned they roast and blend their own beans. Well someone here knows what they are doing because this was the smoothest coffee drink at a coffeehouse I think I have yet to have. And hey ... I lived in Seattle for almost twenty years I have been to some coffeehouses, let me tell ya! 

I went to their website www.GrindersCoffeeCo.com 
It's a great little website. It explains the place well  ,as well as their coffee and I also learned they have a rotating art showing on the walls that change the 1st Saturday of each month and jazz or  blues playing on the patio the 2nd Saturday of each month. 

I might just be there for this first Music night in 2010. Say Hi if you see me around there getting my caffeine buzz on anytime.
I'll try it again before I give them a five star rating.,Nice little coffee shop. They have their own roaster, which is a big plus.

They have a nice large table, for setting up a laptop or whatnot.

They have ample outdoor seating, which is always a big bonus!

They tend to close on the early side; 7-8 PM, which, for a coffee shop is kinda weird.

They have delicious blended and iced drinks, as well as their hot drinks. They have a selection of bulk beans, but I have not tried any of them as of yet.

The Sunnyslope Art Walk happens in this shopping center, so that could be your opportunity to stop in and check them out.,I always see this place on my way to work, but it kindof looks like a Starbucks from the street. I needed my coffee fix this morning; however and the office foldgers was not going to cut it (best part of waking up my ass), so I stopped in.

This place is actually really cool. Flyers for local events posted, ratty comfortable looking furniture, completely unpretentious.

I ordered my cafe americano from a man behing the counter with Sammy Haggar curls and a rad scar on his cheek. I thought of him as a kind pirate. 

My drink was up in no time flat and I am sipping it right now at work and in heaven. I know a cafe americano doesn't have that many ingredients and is difficult to screw up...but most places I go have terrible burned espresso which they graciously water down hardcore so that I can't taste it as much. This stuff is flavorful yet smooth. I will be back tomorrow morning for a cup maybe give myself enough time to try a pastry and test those chairs.,Grinders is a little cup of heaven nestled next to the mountains in Sunnyslope.  Run by Dennis Miller (NOT of SNL), he has been roasting and brewing his coffee ever since this shopping center opened almost 10 years ago.  He features the artwork of local artists each month as well as wi-fi while you are enjoying your beverage.  Be sure to come on the Second Saturday of each month to enjoy their ongoing series of Jazz & Blues.  You never know who's going to show up and perform!  But you can be assured you WILL have a foot stompin' good time!,Superb Coffee. Pathetic sandwiches and paninis. Hated the place after i ate the sandwich. i was told there were not veggies available at all. Then why sell a sandwich? They threw some chicken on the bread and gave it, after which i threw it in the trash.,Outstanding coffee and incredibly sweet earth child barista (don't think I'm allowed to say ""hippy chick"").  And the first time I had their iced mocha (I think triple shot espresso) I exclaimed ""wow, that's damn fine coffee"".  Wish it wasn't 20 miles from my house!

They need to get a new couch or two in there.   But the coffee was so damn good I'd forgive them anything.",0.290223
Gold Bar Espresso,"The owner was very concerned about the bad experience previously reported and apparently dealt with the issue. I have returned several times and can happily report no further snarkiness.,The coffee was good, the place was clean and the staff was friendly. I really like it, and would like to go back when I'm in Phoenix. 

Unfortunately it's TOO EXPENSIVE.,First impressions? Student hang-out. Showed up around 7pm, and the interior was filled with students and their laptops, availing themselves of the free WiFi. Lots of options for both coffee and tea drinkers, especially if you have a sweet tooth. Our barista pointed out some of their candy bar themed coffee drinks, and there were easily a dozen or more. Ample outdoor seating with a smoking area for those who care to mix vices. All in all, not a bad spot, and I'm looking forward to going back and trying out their selection of baked goods as well.,Amazing Owners and Staff always friendly.  I tried the New Matcha Frozen Frap its like Candy SOOO Good. Love this place locally owned and operated..,the baristas are awesome, great atmosphere! they knew my regular drink after 3 times coming there- they have a great selection of coffee drinks and teas and their toddy is amazing!,The bottom line is Gold Bar is a local spot with a devoted clientele.  It is chill and comfortable.,I don't know how I've never made it to Gold Bar before! It's slightly hidden, tucked back by the Basha's and slightly obscured by the Starbucks on the corner. It's definitely the eclectic, funky Tempe cafe I've been looking for. The decor is kitschy - stained glass, random art, cool colors, and great signs. Aside from the basics, their coffee menu has an impressive number of custom drinks with cute names. They  serve cakes and pastries, which I were told come from a Kosher bakery in Phoenix. The place is cute and cool, and the patrons seem to be a mix of students and musically-inclined hipsters. They are definitely on the pricey side, but it seem to be a good place to spend the afternoon working. They have live music on Friday and Saturday evenings, and classical guitar on Sunday mornings. I got my first Gold Bar stamp card - I LOVE being rewarded for eating and drinking. 

My barista was awesome. He was personable and very friendly. He suggested I get my chai latte with a mix of vanilla and raspberry (his fave) and it was great. He presented my mug of chai with the prettiest Latte Art flower - I very much enjoyed Gold Bar, and will definitely make it a regular stop.,Darn good drip coffee, a very smooth iced coffee, plus the full range of expresso drinks, all made with Allann Bros coffee beans. This family business also offers a wide choice of teas brewed to order. And pastries... OK, step away from the pastry case and don't even look at the ice-chilled, fresh whipped cream dispenser unless you've fasted for the day!
At any time, Goldbar is a good place to meet and talk. Friday and Sunday evening, enjoy straight ahead jazz by a quintet including one of the owners on sax.,Received a message from the owner saying they do have some sugar free syrups, so I'll give them another try next time I want some coffee!,Love this coffee shop. Love the ambiance. Great cozy place to read a book. Coffee is pretty good as well. Super friendly staff and yummy treats as well :),This is a cute little place with fun artwork. I took off a few stars because it is one of those places that turns into a library for the students. It was so quiet my friend and I waited until we were outside to start chatting. Our drinks were ok and the barista was friendly so other than the study atmosphere it was good.,The interior of Gold Bar looks like a hip, arty 75 year old woman's living room. The coffee is good (Allann Bros.) but pricey. Really pricey. But that may have something to do with its being located directly across the parking lot from a very busy Starbucks.

If you're in the area, it's a comfortable ""let's chat"" kind of place.,I come here 4 days a week. Great staff. Not really much you can say about a coffee shop. Prices are reasonable and they have a punch card (10 drinks, get one for $1). I think that is kind of dumb though. I buy 10 drinks at approximately $4 then I am spending $40. Why can't I get a free drink? You're really going to charge me a buck? Regardless, I keep coming back. My one MAJOR complaint is their internet really stinks. Some days it barely works. Sadly, that is why I will go there when I don't need my internet and will visit their competitor down the street (Xtreme Bean) when I need to use my computer. If they had solid internet I would probably live there and it would definitely be 5 stars! 

P.S. Sometimes you can catch the Subway connection from next door and it is better!,I like it.,I love the artwork and the staff. The coffee is good, but the prices are too high.,Locally owned by great people! Yummy lattes, and live music and game night! What more could you want?!
This place really goes out of their way to offer more than the standard coffee experience.  When the owner found out it was our first time there, she went out of her way to tell us all about their nightly events, give us an extra punch on our first card, and make sure we knew about their specialty drinks.
Considering they're in the same parking lot with a Starbucks, you know they have to be offering something special to stay in business.  
Support the locals! Go to Gold Bar!!!,It wasn't a very big coffee shop. My boyfriend and I met a small group of friends around 2 pm on a Saturday. The place was crowded with people stopping in. There was only one person to run the counter so the service was pretty slow. I told the woman I found the place on Yelp because it said to mention that for a .50 off per drink discount. She didn't give us the correct discount. I guess I should've spelled it out so she understood what I was wanting. I ordered the Mocha Especiale. It was alright, but it tasted a little gritty to me. So, overall I wasn't that impressed and it's a place I can live without.,Locally owned, delicious espresso, welcoming atmosphere, friendly staff, good treats. 
I stopped by at 9:30 p.m. and the place was packed with a young crowd, working on computers or chatting about art and music. I think I just found my favorite coffee shop in Tempe.,I really do love this place. First off, the staff here is so kind and helpful. This is the small indie kind of cafe where the staff and owners get to know their patrons and there  are definitely ""regulars"" who come here everyday. I love the atmosphere of this place as well. It feels very homey and it is extremely comfortable. The coffee here is fantastic. They have a lot of different drinks to choose from, and if you like mocha's you are in luck because they have a whole list dedicated to specialty mocha's which are quite delicious and unique combinations! They also sell pastries which are absolutely fantastic. I had the opportunity to try a plethora of things including danishes, black and white cookie, lamington, and muffins. Everything is fresh and delicious!I like how all the pastries come from locals and they do not buy or mass produce their goods. It's not on their menu, (a barista suggested it to me once and it is addicting if you like banana flavor) but try an iced vanilla chai with a pump or so of banana syrup. SO GOOD. I love this place and despite the somewhat high price of drinks, I really feel it is worth it.,The bar was not gold and it was not a bar so much as a counter.  I did not see any gold bars in evidence.  My espresso drink was not concocted in any way involving a gold bar. So basically the name is a total misnomer in my book.

I did notice that the employee who made my espresso drink was friendly and helpful, that the drink was good, that the place has free wifi and that there was plenty of seating.

Good product, atmosphere and service, no gold bar to be found.

This concludes my review of Gold Bar Espresso.

Thank you for reading.,staff could and should be nicer given that my coming in pays the bills. Coffee could and should be cheaper to keep me coming in. not enough outlets. I MUST COMPUTE!,Nice place.  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)

+ Good coffee.  I forgot what the name is, but I once asked the barista to make me something with lots of chocolate.  It was a mocha made with Ghirardelli chocolate I believe.  I was in love.

+ I've been here three times and every time the employees have been respectful and fast.

- Their food is... well... gross.

+ Good atmosphere.  Great place to study because most of the time loners sit inside and groups sit outside.  If you like alone time when you read/study/whatever (like me), you'll like it here.

- I will sadly have to agree with many other reviews: the prices are not worth the coffee.,for the ambiance and idea behind this coffee shop, i give it two stars.  it's cute, they have a nice espresso machine.

the espresso was bitter.  i paid $3.00 for 3 shots.  i added my sugar and half and half at the some what dirty side bar (mostly drips and sugar crystals about, but dried liquid, so it had been there a while).

about 3 sips into the drink, i got a huge clot of half and half that must have fallen into my cup from the container as i poured it.  i couldn't bring myself to drink much more, i took the lid off and sipped it, but it was not that great, so i threw it away.

i don't know if i would try this again, seeing as the major part that sells me on a coffee place is the quality of coffee, and the cleanliness of the place.,I love this place! So friendly and they have really cool teas. Today I'm drinking coconut cocoa tea, which isn't actually that sweet but has a wonderful coconut aroma. I like writing here and I will continue to be a loyal customer.,So I am not usually in the Tempe area, but a friend told me about this place. So I though I would go try it out. I got a Grande Latte that was around $4. Not a bad price. But what made it worth it was that I guess this Friday I went was a Free Shot Friday. So I got an extra Espresso shot in my latte making it a triple for $4 bucks...no that is a deal. Not sure if they always have the promotion on Fridays. But it sure did make my morning a little better.

Their menu is very easy to read and give those no too educated in the was of coffee a good description of what each drink is and how it is made.

The had a ton of great looking pastries even though I didn't sample any. Cakes, Eclairs, Scones, and I think even what looked like cheesecake. 

The decor was very interesting. An old fashion coffee house meets a gypsy vibe. I think they have Wifi too. I saw a few people on there computers.

The service was a little slow I think. Felt like I was waiting for my drink for 10 minutes and the place was not really that busy. This was probably because of the guy ahead of me when I walked in who had about 7 different modifications to his drink. I have worked in a coffee place and those people are kind of annoying. So I will let them slide on the time of service.

Overall a great experience. Would have been 3 stars, but when you get something for free, in my book that is an automatically another star.,Gold Bar is not hip, it is not polished, it is not new and it is not standard Phoenix/Tempe.  Gold Bar is easy to like and easy to sit in for a couple of hours grading papers.

I come from cozy towns in Michigan, where when the snow falls heavy the streets grow quiet and everyone you meet has tinge of red to their cheeks and the need for a warm drink.  There's a kind of empathy that comes with this quaintness that is hard to find in Phoenix.  It was there in the old 3 Roots but you had to trade it for slow service. It's not there at Cartel, but that's not what Cartel is about.

Gold Bar is charming.  You're transported, as much as can be hoped for in our strip mall culture, to a cozy living room in another town when you spend a couple of hours here.  The family that runs it knows many of the customers names, they sell hearty foods and heavy drinks.

Just from overhearing the son of the owners talk I can tell you: They have stamp cards. Monday is Pastry stamp Monday. Friday is Extra Shot Friday. Friday and Sunday nights are live Jazz. Sunday morning has classical guitar.  Saturday night is game night, where they have drawings every 20 minutes to give you free drinks, eats and prizes.

So, it is quiet and you can hear everybody else, the drinks are a bit expensive and the food is only okay.  All of those things add up to make this place a little slice of home for someone who is not the biggest fan of living in the city that ate the desert.,i've never heard of this place, but i received a brief history from one of my friends on this establishment. Gold Bar was located where Xtreme Bean now stands on the (south west corner of McClintok and Southern) a long time ago. I guess Xtreme Bean bought them out of their location or they just took over... that's why they moved to the location there at now (North East corner of Southern and McClintok) 

i thought this place is really neat, they have comfy seats and outside-furniture inside with cushions for your bum. It's a smaller place which to me is a lot better especially when you're trying to get things done, no distraction like loud people or a piano playing. 

the only thing i didn't like about this place was the price of their latté it was the same price as starbucks or some other place and it didn't even taste that good. i was disappointed on that fact. Maybe i just ordered a bad drink so i'm going to go back and give them another try....,This place has promise, and I'll be certain to give it another shot. Lots of seating inside and out, so it looks like a great place to hole up for work. Good vibe, and it looks like they have live music from time to time. Perhaps it was just an off day, but the barista on duty was pretty green. Ordered a cappuccino, but it was more of a latte. 

Oh well. I'll be back.,I can't believe I haven't reviewed the BEST coffee shop in the East Valley or perhaps even in the entire Phoenix area.  When I had no life (opressed by school, thesis and MCAT) I would spend most of my waking hours at Gold Bar.  I should have been paying them rent.

 Its more than just a coffee shop... it just has this irreplicable ATMOSPHERE and the friendliest employees I've ever encountered.  Its family owned and everyone that works there is somehow related to one another... creates this really personal vibe and you know they take great pride in their product.  

Allan Bros. coffee is the best.  I have even had a friend in Oregon bring some down here for me.  I refuse to drink Starbucks garbage after my palatte has become accustomed to Allan Bros. Its almost annoying because now I frankly dislike any other coffee besides Allan Bros.  Delectable. 

If you are too fancy for plain coffee or want to color outside the lines...try the Granida... so YUMMY! Its frap'esque' but infinitely better.  Also their iced Toddy is great if you want a jolt of caffiene without the bitterness of regular iced coffee.  

Every Sunday morning there is LIVE MUSIC (guitar) at Gold Bar... so lovely and worth checking out.  

***remember your punch card... after 10 punches you get a $1.00 drink! :),Another one of my many indie coffee shops that I love to support.  Gold Bar used to be my main spot to interview high-level candidates as a recruiter, and if they appreciated locally-owned business (which a lot of them did!) they were impressed by the selection.

The coffee is great, I'll be honest I'm much more about the ambiance than the expresso itself, and this is probably the most unique in that regard that I've found.  

I will agree with another reviewer that the prices are a little higher than most places, even for just plain old coffee, but for a place offering live entertainment etc, it's well worth it!,While still filthy from traveling and not wanting to go back to Steve's espresso in Tempe just yet (I love that place a lil too much), I decided I remembered how to get to Xtreme Bean coffee place. Instead I ended up in a vulture circle around Southern and McClintock in the dreaded beige strip mall purgatory, trying to remember desperately which generic store front housed the soy-friendly Xtreme. Still groggy, I decided to ""fuck it"" and just do Starfucks.

 I parked in an extremely awkward spot near the taco place (I have no idea why) and while walking around the megaplex of suburbia, I saw...wrought iron cafe tables? What? Gold Bar? Espresso? Double WHAT? I wandered over there, it wavered in the sun like a desert mirage, and as I got closer I saw happy people of all types sitting in some awesome metal seating (very mod) conversing, smoking, drinking delicious looking cups of coffee. Going through the door, I saw a cozy, dark (but still well lit by sunlight) cafe with yummies in the display case and a friendly barista. They don't have any breakfast sandwiches, a big minus for me, but the bagel with butter and cream cheese I had was pretty damn bangin'. They also had soy, and made me a cafe mocha with soy-yummers! Delish! The total amount was around 6 something, which always feels strange for bagel and coffee when I could have gotten an actual breakfast for the cost...but then again the decaf coffee would have tasted like bum residue with dish soap. So there you have it. The owner was there and extremely friendly and apparently they have a website of guitar and jazz. What a happy place! And there were plenty of regulars relaxing or running in to get coffee while friends waited in the car in the ample parking lot. Totally glad I discovered this place so close by as well-yippie! Gold Bar-word.

***

After repeated visits, I have to say I am just not as fond of this place. The prices are OUTRAGEOUS for coffee and food, and I don't feel like I get my moneys worth at all. It feels weird to sit in there and when its too cold to just sit outside and stare at a dying strip mall parking lot, I take it to go and walk around near by Kiswanis Park. 

I feel bad not hurrahing this place, but with Steves Espresso a block away and Tempe based indies Bunna Cafe and Three Roots vastly superior in price and quality (not to mention ambiance), I just say it is an alternative to Starbucks.

Shrug.,Two stars seem kind of low, but the description of ""Meh.  I've experienced better"" is suitable.  Three stars is ""A-OK,"" not how I would describe this place.  I love to support local business - would much rather give my money to a local business owner than some big chain conglomerate.  Sorry Gold Bar, but you'll have to do better if you want to earn business from me.  I won't support local business if they aren't up to standards.  

This was the first time that I have visited this place.  I waited a very long time to place my order with just one person ahead of me.  It seemed to take the coffee person 10 minutes to make one coffee drink.  I ordered some kind of iced tea.  They used the same tea bags that I use at home, nothing special, it wasn't a loose leaf specialty, which is what I would expect from the prices they charge.  I also have to question how old that tea was - it certainly tasted like it was old.......

I waited for a very long time to get my tea.  I finally went up to the counter to ask and they said, ""Oh, we put orders over on the other side.""  I would have thought that they would have called out my order when it was ready rather than just leaving it sit there on the counter.  That's what most places do!  

This place was crowded on the day that I was there, which surprised me.  Lots of people with computers doing work and a few study groups with toddlers running around.  It seemed cramped and small with all of the people stuffed in there.  Wondering why so many people go there......

The other thing that I really disliked was that I had to go into the back of the place to use the restroom.  Dark, dingy and dirty were the words that came to mind.  Yuck - if the bathrooms and back of house aren't clean, it makes me wonder about the rest of the place........,I'm not a coffee snob, but I love a good Americano.  

This place has the charm you'd expect from a locally owned coffee shop complete with  eclectic decor, artwork on the walls, odds-and-ends of gaudy lamps and stained-glass windows.  The coffee is pretty good from what I have experienced.  The air-conditioning is right where it needs to be as well. 

Most important factor for this business:  very nice staff.  That alone makes me want to come by more often.,Yum-freaking-y!

I really like this place.  The inside mood is cool if I was a student doing some work or was able to bring in my laptop for some non-cubicle focus time.  But in this kind of weather - and whenever it's good - it's the outside every time.  Simple woven metal tables and chairs make for a nice casual hang out space.  On an average morning you'll see ASU students, folks escaping the office and folks meeting friends.

I haven't jumped into their baked goods yet because they generally seem a bit more brunch or dessert than breakfast to me.  Though they had this awesome chocolate bundt that was really trying to get my attention. 

But my main reason for going, and recommending the place, is the coffee.  Super yumtastic.,This place is great.  I must say, in their defense, I have never had bitter espresso.  Everything here, especially the Mocha Especiale, is great.

Not to mention they tend to survive despite having a Starbucks across the way.  That's because their coffee beats Starbucks' rancid, burnt dishwater-tasting swill hands down.  They also have a great staff.

The sad thing is, I never get a chance to just hang out.  I'm always on the go.  I'm hoping that will change soon, because just walking in there relaxes me.  

I also occasionally enjoy their pastries.  I don't know about in the past, but they currently come from a local Kosher bakery.  Haven't tried the cakes or pie yet, but they look delicious.  

In summary (since I'm in a hurry to go pick someone up and run by there at the moment as it is), great atmosphere, great service, great coffee.  And, no, I don't think it's too expensive.  The prices here are about normal for most places I've been to.,I like this place.  It's tucked in a Bashas strip mall, NOT facing the road.  I found this place when I was running some errands, and thought I would give it a shot.

Ok, so I like it here.  Free wifi, cute layout, indoor and outdoor seating.  Seating is limited, in the sense that its a lot of two tops or a few 4 tops, but nothing for a larger group, like lets say a random study group or whatnot.

They serve pastries, and I purchased one.  The girl at the counter said that the WIFI was free, but they wanted you to make a purchase, which is a reasonable request.  The drinks, in comparison, are priced more at a starbucks level, from staring at the menu.  prepare to spend $4 on a mocha, and $2.50-$4 on a pastry.  

It is quiet in here, no music. But, some people need that, and if I was studying, I would want it quiet in here as well.  

This seems like a great little spot.  I have not tried the coffee, yet, but its SO much better then getting starbucks!  The girl who helped me behind the counter seemed to know her stuff.   I like that in a good coffee shop-staff who know thier stuff!

What I do NOT like about this place is the lack of bathrooms.  There is one bathroom, but you have to physically cut through the ""backroom area"" which is ugly and unkept looking.  Its kind of like back in the old days when you were a kid and had to cut through the stock room at the grocery store to get to the bathrooms. I was not impressed with the bathroom situation, and even though the bathroom was clean, I didn't like the fact that I felt like I was using a staff bathroom.  Not cool.

So, support your local shops and come here and enjoy.,Gold Bar has a lot of potential, but disappoints me.

1.  The decor is typical ""throw junk on the wall"" chic.  There's a bit too much clutter and not enough seating.  

2.  The prices are a bit steep.  A large mocha will cost you well over $4.00

3.  The espresso is somewhat weak.  Of the 9 or 10 places in Tempe/ASU area I've tried, Gold Bar is the worst when it comes to espresso strength.  I only knew there was coffee in my latte because it was light brown in color.

It still tastes better than Starbucks I guess and it's close to home.  But I've had much better.,Although I was very tempted to give this place 4-stars, I had to settle on 3.  The atmosphere is great, an ideal place for a casual meeting, or just getting some work done.  It's cozy and interesting inside, the staff is nice.  However, on my last visit, the cappuccino I ordered was wayyy too foamy and didn't really taste much like a cappuccino, or much like anything.  This may be due to the skills of that particular barista, but next time I stop in, I'll probably just save my money and order a drip coffee.  However, still a great place to hang out.,I have frequented this place a couple of times but have not been able to make up my mind about it.  It has a friendly atmosphere and lots of space to sit and work.  I read how some Yelpers can't comprehend why it's still in business given how sub par their coffee and service can be. But I think it's because it has that ""Cheers"" factor.  A place where everybody knows your name, sort of speak.  The times that I've been there, the owners and regulars seem to have a good connection.  All I know is, I like it better than Xtreme Bean.  They are much ""cleaner."",Created a YELP page because I was annoyed with this place. Maybe they have great coffee but thats not my beef with them. 

I saw they were listed as a great place to smoke a cigar and have a cup of jo. Understanding that some great places do not allow cigars (4Peaks, The Yardhouse...), I called them and said ""I understand you guys are cigar smoker friendly?''. The woman on the phone answered, ""Yes"". When I inquired on a smoking area she said ""Just keep them as far away from us as possible"". Rude.

Thats not ""cigar smoker friendly"" at all! A simple, ""Actually, we do discourage patrons from smoking cigars"" would have sufficed. I would have even still went for a simple cup of coffee.

Again, maybe their coffee is great...but I'll never know for sure now. Drink Lux!,I agree with Chris L.; I was disappointed with the cafe.  Granted, I was looking for a college-type coffeehouse where I could grade papers, and this place just didn't have that sort of lounge-y feel that even certain Starbuck$$ have.  There was no background music being played, and even with my ipod/headphones on, I was distracted by nearby conversations.  I got much more work done at 3 Roots near campus.,Closer to my house than Cafe Solo but it's a little claustrophobic inside. The star rating is for the espresso. It was okay but not the true experience of espresso where the aroma of coffee fills one's entire mouth and nose upon each sip. My guess is that their machine does not generate enough pressure to extract the really delicate flavor components. Seems that folks in Tempe are just fine with $tarbux though so the owners may be excused for complying with market demand.

Staff was nice but untrained on the day I visited. If this place were on my way to work I would probably be a regular here.,Gold Bar Espresso is a cozy, locally owned and operated coffee spot.  Its prior location in a retired bank vault (hence the name) was presumably much more charming than its current Valley-standard strip mall locale, but it makes up for it with friendly and helpful staff.  

I spent the late afternoon reading in Gold Bar with excellent live accoustic guitar for background.  This is a fine place to purchase and enjoy a Sunday New York Times.

The pumpkin pie was absolutely delicious.

Gold Bar also serves non-coffee drinks including teas, chai, and decadent hot chocolate also available in a refreshing iced format.,If we were able to give 0 stars... I would ask to give -1.

I live nearby, and am sad to see that a coffeeshop that sells coffee this horrible is still in business in my neighborhood.

Not only was the breve mocha that I ordered disgusting, so was the process of watching the barista make my drink.

They use hershey's chocolate from a dirty nacho cheese style pump with chocolate sauce dripping down the sides, and coagulated into a thick cap at the tip of the nozzle.  *Disgusting.  

The espresso shot was made without care, or concern for the fact that it was done way too quickly, and with espresso grounds that were ground way before I walked in the door.  Possibly way before the barista started her shift.   *Gross

And finally.  The milk.  She steamed the milk with the automatic steam wand.  This was a huge red flag.  Those are notorious for burning milk and making disgusting drinks.  Well, both were accomplished. 

The steam wand was tinted white from lack of cleaning.  And the worst part was that near the end of the wand was a DARK CHEESE that had accumulated from burning milk and not cleaning the wand after every use. 
Which is FREAKIN - DISGUSTING.

I wasted 5 bucks on an overpriced small mocha, and threw it away after taking a sip.  

Hundreds of businesses in the area close down every year, and there are more realty signs in strip malls in this neighborhood than actual storefronts.  AND I really don't understand why this place hasn't joined the many defunct businesses and starry eyed entrepreneurs in the unemployment line.  

If you own a coffeeshop.  Coffee should be your passion.  
If you own a bait shop.  Fishing should be your passion.
If you just want to open up a business that mirrors a nearby popular chain (short, tall, grande), please stop wasting space in the strip mall and get a day job in a cubicle.

Never going back, warning my friends about this place, and am probably going to contact the health department on Monday.,Errrbody hatin' on Gold Bar!

Personally, I like their coffee (OK, actually I like the Iced Mocha). I went there almost every single day (sometimes two) through college, so I have some loyalty. Consequently, I think I put one of their kids through college with the amount of coffee I bought. I actually like the fact they don't have music blaring in my ear. It made Gold Bar a much better study environment. On weekends they do have live music (jazz, classical guitar). I can't say anything about the food, except for the yummy McTavish cookies. Sitting is limited. Hours are great. And they are still around despite Starbuck moving in on their territory. HISSBOO.

PLUS, they are open on Thanksgiving & Christmas Day for a couple of hours with $1 coffee. HELLSYAH!,The husband, wife and son team who own gold bar are absolutely lovely, lovely people. That goes for the rest of the staff too. They remember you! Even when you make a trip back from a three month long hiatus. 

All those GIANT pastries are homemade by the wife. They're damn good. (The holiday sugar cookies are extremely popular. And pretty.) 

Each table has a lamp and there are plenty of outlets (it kind of looks like a fire hazard, but hey that's okay!) So, it's a great study spot in the afternoon, before it gets over populated. 

The staff knows their way around the menu and they also offer to make you something else if you don't like their suggestion. I've always liked their suggestions. :)

You can leave your punch card there in an alphabetically sorted bin, which is convenient if you tend to loose those things like me. 

The downside is the bathroom. It's a little bit awkwardly placed. You have to work your way through the ""kitchen area"" to get to it. 

OH! BONUS! I used to take my weiner dog here. The baristas would always have treats for him. He really likes gold bar too.,I'm not a big coffee drinker, but i love hot chocolate, and Gold Bar makes some pretty good hot chocolate. I like the Chocolate Especiale. Nice and creamy, not too strong (so you can have a larger cup and not feel guilty). 

There's also a pair of comfy chairs directly across from a grandfather clock that quietly chimes every so often. I like hot chocolate. I like comfortable chairs. And I especially like chiming clocks. So, I like this place a lot.,In town drinking a lovely mocha.  It is delish! Not bitter and the the place is adorable! I am drinking my coffee and the owners are just amazing! Wish we had a place like this in Tucson! I give my vote to this place for sure!,My favorite coffe",0.229304
Giant Coffee,"Love Giant Coffee.  Fun place to hang, do a little work, and drink some good coffee.,Giant Coffee really misleads their customers. The size of the coffee there is comparable to any other coffee house. ""Normal Sized Coffee"" might be more fitting.,Been to Giant twice now, and both times had a good but not memorable visit.  Big plus is the ambiance and overall look of the place.  I bet it is simply fantastic when they can open the front doors/panels in the evening and let the cool air come in.

But the coffee has been just okay. Their sweeter drinks seem a better bet, as they are rather tasty. The cappuccinos I've had have both been a little foamy - not bad, just not great. I'll be sticking with sweetened drinks from now on.

So if you're looking for a great place to land and visit, check it out.,So, yes, it's a great location, 1 star. And a great interior, 1 star. After my 3rd visit I am officially ready to write them off my coffee list. I love supporting local businesses, but this place just isn't my cup o' jo. 
Yesterday morning I went to get a latte, I ordered a small with an extra shot. The price went from $3 to $4.65, What the ....what?!? The esspresso just seemed to have a sour taste, and since I had to have my caffine, and wouldn't dare to go near the break room sludge, I forced myself to drink this. I actually wished I had gone to starbucks and I'm just not that kind of girl!!!! Maybe I am coffee spoiled, but I just couldn't palette this stuff. I am also sad they never have veggie options for breakfast burritos and they don't even carry carmel for a carmel latte?!? And the honey vanilla latte is too sweet for my taste. I am glad that some people like it, but I would rather be at Jobot or Lola's. And yes they do now except cards, but are not card friendly if you only order 1 drink.,Giant Coffee is my favorite coffee shop in Phoenix. 

Do I need to write more? 

Well, every time I've been in the baristas/os are nice, helpful and generally classy individuals. The coffee is excellent, my favorite is the honey vanilla latte, but I've yet to be disappointed. The breakfast burritos take a little long, but are worth the wait if you're in the mood for a burrito and coffee combo. The setting is laid back, and one of the few places I can go read a book or catch up with a friend- it's surreal how well Giant works for both. The only downside is they close way to early (like 7 or 8).,Diggin' Matt and Ernie Pool's latest concept. Like their other restaurants, Giant Coffee feels comfortable and delivers on the goods. On a hot summer day, the honey vanilla latte (iced with soy milk) was a perfect treat. Topped it with the chocolate-hazelnut cookie and was in heaven!

The always-satisfying Bunky Boutique next door makes this address a total winner!,Yay! I'm a fan pretty much sums it up!

'Giant Coffee'....  hmmm
While I have no idea what the hell that's supposed to mean, I do like that it seems to elicit  playful banter, in which we get to bust out our best porn star voices and use the phrase 'GIANT coffee' in place of other more descriptive words whilst discussing where to go for our Saturday morning fix. It's fun, try it. 

On to the meat and potatoes :

The coffee was good. My mocha was not sweet at all, something I actually enjoyed. There's a fine line between sweet and syrupy and hey, I'd rather have to add a lump of sugar myself than be stuck in nestle chocolate syrup hell. 

The little chicky that took our order was cute and bubbly. She asked if we had ever been there before and seemed to genuinely care that we enjoy our experience. I really like the idea of not yelling out the customers name but table service for coffee also seemed a bit weird. I would prefer the latter of course and could definitely get over the awkwardness.. it's probably just me anyway..

The space itself was outstanding. I am a table girl, not a couch girl (especially if I'm there less to socialize and more to surf). The work counter area is perfect for me as I don't like having people at my back when I'm working on my novel..... okay, checking my facebook, whatever. Having someone at my back when I'm on my computer is a pet peeve of mine and there is enough seating to accommodate multiple people with similar neurosis. High five! 

My only real complaint is the lack of an obvious space or bus-tub in which to leave your empties. Maybe I just missed it. I'm certainly not leaving it on the table and felt kinda silly walking back up to the counter all wide eyed and dorky 'Errrr...hey guys, what do I do with this...'. Again, I'm a neurotic train-wreck so sometimes human interaction gets the best of me. 

So ya, 4 stars!!,Awful service today. They did fail to make the coffee the way I wanted, all I asked was for more ice, less water on my Ice Americano, to which he replied ""We can't do that"".... so I took off...

and after this review, the manager or owner got in contact with me in my twitter account, I thought she was going to apologize for her staff for not wanted to make an ice espresso, but instead she blamed on me, for ""abruptly leave the location"" all i said, ""I don't want anything else, I'll go somewhere else where they can serve my coffee"" that was long enough for her barista to change his mind..
And after the manager contacted me and make this about me, and not that her staff fail to make an ice espresso, and not apologize so I go back and make a better review, instead she accused me of being rude for leaving the place... Now I see where her staff gets that kind of service style.
I STAY BEHIND MY FIRST REVIEW AWFUL, NO WORTH THE TRY.,Yeah, it's a cash-only spot. I've gotten over that. I just don't frequent it as much as other places, because I don't have cash on me all the time. Oh well.

What everyone has Yelped about the ambiance is undoubtedly true: It's a true gem. I wouldn't expect anything less from this beautiful [merz]project building, nor would I from Matt Pool, he of Matt's Big Breakfast and the Roosevelt. It blends the clean lines of modern cool with the rustic reusability of the Bunky Boutique space that shares the same room. Visually stunning!

The coffee is mighty fine, though I wish it was sourced from an in-state roastery. I'm all for sipping from well-crafted beans, but I'm kind of shocked Matt went this route. Still, sourcing from California is probably better from an eco-friendly standpoint than what most places around here do. 

The bathroom, I must say, is the best-smelling men's bathroom in downtown Phoenix. Let's make sure it stays that way. Also, it's Arctic cold in there regardless of time of day. That's amazing during the summer. Let's hope it's equally as toasty come wintertime. 

One caveat: I'm an Americano drinker by default, and I don't like when places recommend (nay, insist) you get the iced coffee alternative instead. A few other places do this, but I know what I like. Just a fair warning to my other Americano friends out there.

Can't say I've tried the pastries yet, but they always look very promising. I'm excited for lunchtime sandwich/salad service to start, as this is the time I'm usually doing my coffee shop visits during the day.,Giant Coffee is what you would get if Apple decided to open a coffee house. 

It's pretty cool and fresh- sleek.  Fantastic coffee and super modern twists to the shop and presentation.  

We stopped in to buy some pastries for a work thing and ended up sitting and having some coffee and hitting up Bunky Bourtique right next to it.  (this was all after having lunch at Thai Hut in the freestanding building right next to it.)  

Everyone there was a loner, sitting with their apple computers checked in and super quiet, and then we- me and the gang walked in and it seemed like it was the most conversation the place had going on in a long time.  But no biggie. 

The coffee was strong, the pastries were sweet and we all went home happy.,Giant Coffee was a beautiful and welcome respite from my pedestrian excursion yesterday in the unexpected blustery wind and cold. The interior is modern and clean, yet comfortable with live! happy yellow flowers placed on every table. I enjoyed a delicious mocha (made with organic Strauss Family milk) and a cheddar dill scone, and the laid back atmosphere and music.,Modern inside trapped in a windy desert outside. I loved my soy americano. Beats going to the local Starbucks. I like to support the little guy. And their coffee was excellent!  I ordered the Americano.

Oh and the Breakfast burrito was delicious! I was the Jalapeno, cheese, egg and potato). OMG. I wanted to buy another one, just to take it home for later!,Three words: Honey Vanilla Latte. Gah! I love it! 

Giant Coffee is a simple and delicious way to start your day. The interior and atmosphere they have created are just gorgeous. The deconstructed vintage charm makes it familiar while the sleek modern layout gives it a calming presence that is downright soothing. 

Matt and Erenia Pool definitely know what they are doing. Just like their other local establishments (Roosevelt Tavern and Matt's Big Breakfast), you can expect to find quality, super fresh ingredients in everything Giant Coffee serves up. It's a difference you can taste. I only wish the tortilla on my yum burrito hadn't been so dry, and that they had at least one gluten free option on the menu so my poor wheat-allergic little sister could have had breakfast too. That is all. 

Overall this place is a real charmer, and deserves your business far more than any Starbucks could ever hope to. Plus it's within walking distance from the downtown library. What more could you ask for? 

P.S. Giant Coffee is no longer cash-only and will happily accept your credit/debit card. How convenient. Yayers!,Recently discovered this place. It is somewhat hidden because it is located just south of McDowell. Stop in and check it out. They have delicious coffee and friendly service. The atmosphere is very relaxed. And they're pet friendly!!!,this place is impressive at first glance. the design is stunning and uses lots of rough materials - wood,concrete, steel & even some sort of lava-rock substance on one of the walls. clean lines, lots of seating. quite a contrast from the homey breakfast joint up the road.

the big open window space at the front is quite alluring (although i'm not sure how practical seeing as this is phoenix after all..)

we had an americano & a quad latte.. both were fantastic & smooth.   we also had some toast with butter & local preserves (can't really go wrong here).. it was nice because one of the baristas came to ask us if we would like the ends of the bread toasted as an added bonus!  

i HATE that it is cash only.  i NEVER have cash on me and this will be a huge deterrent when i am racing to work in the morning and have so many great coffee shops to choose from in the area.

also, i'm not sure how he parking sitch will play out yet.. ?,I've visited Giant Coffee many times, and I'm finally getting around to writing a review. I think my last experience pushed me over the edge to finally writing it. 

Whenever I'm in Phoenix and looking for coffee I usually head to Giant. Nothing against Lux or Lola just down the street, but Giant is more focused on their product. Giant has a standard of sourcing great coffee and using high quality product.

On my last visit I ordered a cappuccino and it was nearly perfect. Warm, but not too hot. Smooth by still having a strong espresso dynamic. Perfect balance. Before I left I went up to the counter to order a cup of coffee to go. They have a great setup for to-go coffee. They brew great coffee in large quantities so that those who are on the go can get a great cup of coffee quickly. The barista was very sweet and informed me the coffee had been sitting for a while. She said it would be a few minutes and she would brew me a fresh pot. It was the middle of the week, and I think there were only two other people in the shop, who had already ordered drinks. How easily could she have served me that mediocre cup of coffee? Very. But this showed her integrity and pride in their coffee to brew a whole new batch just for me. It's the little things like that that impress me the most.

I recommend this coffee shop for anyone in the downtown Phoenix area. Not to mention the cool sliding glass doors in front that they open up when the weather is nice. There's some comfy chairs and cook wooden tables to sit and enjoy the weather from.

PS. The clothing boutique next door is also cool. I found a great hat there.,Honey Vanilla Latte. Three beautiful words. There is a lot to love about Giant Coffee. The Honey Vanilla Latte is one of them. Creamy, sweet goodness.  I've tried replicating it on several occasions, but Giant's HVL is some sort of magical elixir of the creamiest of dairy (which I'm pretty sure is purchased from a local farm) and Bob McClendon's honey. Coffee and chai are delicious and the pastries are tasty. The ambiance is awesome and the staff is super friendly.
On to my not-so-much list. On the food front, I've ordered the breakfast burrito two or three times but have never quite fallen for it.  The prosciutto and eggs had the potential to be killer but didn't QUITE make it to that ""I want to eat you for every meal"" level. My other disappointment is that I don't find hanging out in Giant to be very comfortable. I know that it sounds kind of weird, but the bar stools are kind of awkward to sit on and the chairs just aren't... comfy. They are also kind of strange about charging for extra things like honey. This just seems weird considering the fact that they aren't all that cheap. At Lux, the coffee bar is full of free ad-ins (including McClendon's honey) and I love that.
So, Giant Coffee, I love you for your delicious coffee and chai concoctions but will  probably continue to spend my hanging out time elsewhere.,In the past, I have gone here and the bathrooms have been bad and the baristas have tried to talk me into different drinks. I wanted an iced toddy with two shots. Come to find out, thats like 5 bucks. The barista told me the toddy was good by itself but would not let me sample it. 

More recently, I went in to get ""4 shots on ice with a little heavy cream on the bottom"" because that is what i like to drink. I was informed that it was going to cost me 6 dollars which is double of most places and that she(the barista) was not allowed to alter menu items meaning that she could not add cream to my drink and i had to do it myself. I like it on the bottom, underneath the espresso. and to top it off they were out of all heavy cream and half and half. 

These two experiences ahve really rubbed me the wrong way. I love the shop, but the employees are not too smart in the customer experience area.... and you need daddy's credit card if you wanted to be a regular here because it is expensive.,Giant Coffee is great! I don't live around this area, but I do like to stop in when I'm in the neighborhood. It's got great ambiance, free wi-fi, friendly employees, and, most importantly, amazing coffee! I will most definitely return.,This is the life and i might have just realized it's right before my eyes. 

After reading the negative reviews and a few salient 5 star reviews I can surmise this: This is NW west coffee done in the desert. Get used to it!

I lived in Portland OR and was fueled by Stumptown coffee. Four Barrel is its little cousin, or are they sisters? Competitive brothers? Anyway, it is artisan coffee with emphasis on the process, product and passion. If we could just purge the syrups, fraps and button pressing espresso we would find the coffee gods smiling upon GC.

Giant Coffee have beans, dark...flavorful...hard...b e a n s.    ... anyway, got lost there for a bit. Flag me.

The only real difference between Giant and most NW roasters/cafes is the service. 

In NW, it is kind of lik this: ""Uh you came here to get coffee, you should be lucky we are even making you this awesome espresso and allowing you to drink our art in a cup.... Andddd you still have not ordered. Know what you want before you speak to me.""

In Giant, "" HEY! Lets talk about what you want to talk about, oh you are here for great tasting coffee? I thought we could Socratic method for about 30min?""

I personally dont mind the friendly dispositions, it is refreshing to have a little playful banter with my coffee. Everybody is fighting their own battles, and someone saying have a great day after a single serving convo is worth paying 23cents more than going to Starbucks for a drip.

This is the life and i might have just realized it's right before my eyes...yep.

RL

NOte: If the owner or manager doesn't respect the customer, that is always a no in the world of business. No matter where you go in the world, you can never escape douche bags costumers. Get used to it, and make it opportunity.,Giant Coffee's menu is not exactly giant. It's actually sort of sparse. Much of the wording on said menu is heavily littered with predictable buzzwords such as ""fair trade"", ""organic"", ""recycled"", which kind of never fails to annoy me. While I was standing there contemplating said menu, the air conditioning was blasting so hard I got goose bumps. Then I turned to contemplate the expansive space and saw the humongous front windows/doors were WIDE. OPEN. Yes. Wide open, spilling all the air conditioning out.

Huh?

Instantaneous loss of credibility. 

Yeah. So that said, the cash only deal is a bummer. Does anyone under 50 carry cash anymore? Total pain in the ass. If I have nine dollars on me, I don't to spend it all on overpriced coffee. The coffee itself is okay, very strong and a little burnt, as seems to be the trend in recent years. I could make it palatable with a lot of cream and some funky all-natural organic free trade green sugar-free alternative. It was definitely way too strong for my SO, who made a bit of a sphincter face with his first sip.

The pastries are from Tammie Coe -- tasty, yes, but nothing you can't get elsewhere.

The space IS gorgeous, don't get me wrong, and it's my favorite part of this shop. Disappointingly, the bathrooms are really average. Usually spiffy places like this have bomb ass bathrooms. The attached Bunky Boutique is super cute, and it deserves its own review.

So yeah. Verdict? Too many other places to get coffee in this area... especially ones that open before 7 am, when I'm usually pounding the streets, desperate for caffeine. Time will tell how GC pans out...,Looks great, nice central location, but that's about where the positive review ends.  My latte was okay but my boyfriend thought his (freshly brewed) coffee tasted awful.  Really bad.  And it took about ten minutes to make two coffees, one of them literally ""a cup for coffee.""  And why is the folksy music so LOUD?  It's not metal or punk, people.  It's sort of got that Portland hipster/cooler-than-thou vibe but NO BIKE RACK!   Really?,Megan D., if you slept on twenty mattresses with a raw, coffee bean placed underneath them, I'm sure you would wake up in the morning insisting that the thing was over roasted. I mean, does anything in this city give you that funny, muscle spasm the rest of us recognize as a smile? And really ""too many other places to get coffee in this area?"" Um you do realize we live in Phoenix right? I'm thinking of opening up a cafe myself and calling it ""Not Enough Coffee Places In This Area Megan D!"" 

I just dropped in for the first time yesterday and christened it with one latte, a three hour writing sesh, a smoke break or two, a little bit of coffee shop eaves dropping and even some hardy conversation with the totally friendly baristas. 

The latte was dead on. Smooth and naturally sweet. The ambiance, a calculated balance of place to be seen-idness and just put your headphones on and zone out-ability. And those giant windows, that swirling breeze, the purple and orange sunset, I dare say I want them for my own.  

I'll be back soon for sure with a giant muscle spasm on my face.,.Giant Coffee is the newest venture from the creative genius who brought us Matt's Big Breakfast and Roosevelt. Similar to these other hot spots, Giant Coffee is ultra hip and doesn't disappoint. 

While in town I met with a friend for an espresso, and instantly fell in love with the space. The coffee shop offers a modern and hip retreat from the cement jungle. I am a sucker for ultra modern loft-like spaces so instantly I loved the vibe Giant offered. While I was there they had the space opened up so we had the pleasure of enjoying fresh air while sipping the rich, dark coffee.

The coffee was delicious. I am happy to find a non corporate chain coffeehouse in AZ. The baristas were friendly hipsters, so I felt right at home. =)

There is a $5 minimum if you use a card for payment. But, use a credit card so you can check out the Square technology on their iPad.

This place is top notch and a welcomed addition to my future Phoenix visits.,Good coffee, nice atmosphere. Pastries are great.,Once we found this place (I think we did 3 u-turns), we were happy with what was at the end of the treasure hunt.  This little coffee house is adorable.  It's got a boutique in the same space, it has a groovy selection of furniture, lots of floor to ceiling windows, and a friendly staff...Not to mention my new favorite drink!
I'm always a sucker for my vanilla soy lattes, but this place makes a honey vanilla latte that makes my knees weak.  Such a small addition, such a big impact.

All I can say is, please invest in a sign.  If I had less determination I would have gone somewhere else, or assumed you were out of business.,Wow, what a great space! I could absolutely see myself sitting here in a chair by the open window on a warm day. Loved the decor. My husband and I came by after lunch at Thai Hut. He talked me into a small Honey Vanilla latte. To be honest, I wasn't into the coffee. The roast just isn't my style but I do think alot of people would like it. My husband bought me one of their butter cookies that are intentionally VERY soft in the middle, almost like you are eating raw dough. It was good. Not awesome, but definitely a butter cookie that I have never had like that before. The middle tasted like cheesecake to me, for some reason, but I liked it. I definitely prefer my cookies a little more cooked but I would say I enjoyed this cookie. Even though my experience was just okay, I look forward to returning. The employees were friendly and I loved the atmosphere.,ESPRESSO

I'm a macchiato man, stained through and through, and Matt Poole marks his Four Barrel espresso with Strauss organic milk, so I am a happy man at Giant.  The sparkling water sidecar they serve with espressos and macchiatos is an expert touch. The espresso is smoother, say, than the coppery undertones of Lux, and Giant serves it in handle-less demitasse ceramics that are hot (not too hot) to the touch.

PASTRY and FOOD

The daily breakfast burrito (wrapped for takeaway or reheated and served on a plate in 12-15 minutes) is rarely vegetarian, but when it is, the tortilla is flaky, the eggs fluffy, and the peppers and potatoes local.

The bread pudding is chewy delicious.

I usually opt for the toasted bagel because the fresh-daily cream cheese is varied and fresh (dill or bell paper or carrot).

AMBIENCE

On weekends and afternoons, it's less swarmed than Lux or Lola, and feels open and clean with concrete floors, high ceilings, clean lines, and bold materials (steel, wood, glass).

The floor-to-ceiling glass panels accordion fold back to reveal a totally open front, great for gazing at Cancer Survivor's Park, Phoenix Art Museum, and McDowell & Central Ave.

Bunky next door is sleepy, but every item is artfully placed.  Occasional succulents dot the interior and exterior.

EXTRAS

Giant now accepts credit/debit via the nifty Square app on the house iPad.   The music rarely changes, and I have been hearing the same playlist for about a year (Spoon, Heartless Bastards, etc.).  Giant has dog treats, but I believe they prefer pups to be on the stoop out front.  No bike rack currently but a convenient railing serves just fine.,Giant Coffee is what coffee shops were 10-15 years ago.  Friendly employees, simple menu and well trained baristas with the highest quality equipment available at their fingertips.  

We both ordered honey vanilla lattes.  These were done to perfection.  I ordered soy milk and this was the best soy foam that I have ever tasted, perfectly velvety and just the right amount. I spent years working for a major coffee place that starts with the letter ""S"" and I am a bit of a foam fanatic. 

Also, a beautiful pour on both of the lattes and a great balance of sweet honey and caramel colored espresso. 

I was happy to see rice milk, soy milk and goat milk as options, I will definitely try the honey vanilla with goat milk next time.  

My only disappointment was that aside from the packaged bars, and thanks for carrying Larabars, there were not any non-dairy pastry type alternatives.  

This is a coffee shop done right, we will be back.,Ive been to giant several times now and I am a fan!!! I went this morning and took my man - he loved it!!
The simplicity of the space (recycled and modern) is the perfect combination for me to work or enjoy a morning drink.
The coffee is delicious, some of the best in the valley, and I like that they have a variety of delish items to nosh on...my only complaint about the food is that the burritos are made in the am and served throughout the day, so there is no opportunity to 'alter' them, I would like egg whites please!
Lastly, Giant has consistently had great service, I am happy to say that it is lacking the pretentious attitude that much of the downtown coffee scene exhibits.
Overall, a shining star among the downtown coffee houses.,Giant is so wonderfully great. My two go-to drinks - the Pour Over and just good old fashioned shots of espresso (with the sparkling water chaser they give you!). The pour-over beans change with whatever awesome Four Barrel bean they've ordered that week - which is fine by me! I've tried the Rwanda, which is by far the best, the Colombia and the Guatemala. I have to enjoy the delicious 16 oz of heaven for a good 10-20 minutes. With an apple... with their biscotti... with nothing. Just try the Pour Over! Their espresso is smooth and tasty. The baristas are helpful, educational without being pretentious. Amen brothers & sisters!

Now, I feel like I'm betraying Giant by only giving them 4 stars, because really they are one of the best in Arizona. But the iced toddy did not work for me. It's HOT in AZ... and if you're going to rock an iced toddy, it needs to be excellent. So I would say they should perhaps revisit their toddy beans or brewing method? Perhaps I just caught the drink on an off day. 

RUN to Giant Coffee!!,Ack!  So I was terribly excited while waiting months and months for Giant to open because 1) I like the tucked away location 2) I love coffee and 3) We spend a lot of time at the library.

So this morning after scooping up some Krispy Kreme donuts (mmmm) to take over to my friend Kate's house for brunch, I decided to pop by and grab a coffee to go since the previous 2 attempts at visiting Giant were met with a ""closed"" sign.

I gave 2 stars because I really do like the space.  There were a few people hanging out and I walked up to the counter where 2 girls were working.  The girl behind the cash register was talking to a guy at the counter.  I then saw the cash only sign which wasn't such a big deal to me as I had some cash in my car today, though normally I don't and probably wouldn't have made the trek to CVS as I was in a hurry and had my 3 yr. old in tow.

I asked the girl not talking if she could start my drink while I ran out to get my money.  She told me to order from the other girl.  I took two steps to my left and stood behind the chatting guy.  They kept chatting.  No bueno.  I looked at the other girl again who was just standing there, and again asked her if I could order my drink.  She looked at the talking girl and finally said ""sure.""

I ordered 2 shots of espresso over ice with a shot of vanilla.  My summer morning caffeine jolt.  I was told by said girl that she couldn't make this for me.

""Excuse me????""  I was told that she was not allowed to make this, as the espresso was to only be ordered in so it could be drank (drunk?) within 10 minutes for the ""flavor branding"" of Giant.  I tried to persuade her again, letting her know I didn't want to drink it there - nor did I want to drink it hot, as I'd just been hanging out in a 105 degree parking lot for the past hour.  I was told ""no.""

NO????  SERIOUSLY???  This girl - who I didn't even know - was telling me what I could or couldn't drink when I hadn't had ANY caffeine yet!  It's probably a good thing my daughter was with me after all, as being turned down for espresso + PMS don't co-exist very happily.

She asked if I'd like something different.  I simply said ""no,"" when I really wanted to say oh so much more with included %%$$&*(#*$^$ words.  

I will not be back.  Thankfully there are other options (with my #1 being Royal Coffee) and I would have even made the trip up to Lux if I hadn't been in a hurry.

So french pressed coffee at Kate's it was, and I would strongly recommend that Matt get over his ""flavor branding"" theory if he wants to thrive and to teach his employees the concept of the customer being right if they are polite, have cash, and aren't asking for something ridiculously out of the ordinary.

Jeesh.,Giant coffee now uses credit card machines....now offering espresso to go....but central phoenix is inundated with great coffee shops, no reason to return to a just so-so one. I think it's the honey latte that's saved them in my book.,My experience here has been pretty bad. First time I went here I ordered a latte it was so weak that it just tasted like milk. The second time I thought I would just order another shot... I ordered a Vanilla Latte with an Extra shot, what I recieved was a regular latte which was weak again, when I asked for the vanilla I was told that it costs extra and so I said alright I thought thats what i paid for... Gave them an extra dollar for the vanilla and I ended up drinking what tasted like a Vanilla milk.

Do yourself a favor and stick to Lola's, Cartel, and Lux. Places that have both atmosphere and knowledge of how to extract a perfect shot.,First time at Giant and I have to say, the employees are super friendly, building is gorgeous and coffee was delicious. I will definitely be coming back! Bonus, Bunky boutique inside is fun to walk around in as you drink your coffee!,Great coffee shop...
I am originally from Seattle and love a good cup of coffee.  Giant Coffee is a wonderful establishment with friendly service and excellent coffee.  Let me list the things I love about this place. 
1. Attention to detail (Strauss milk)(high quality soy milk)
2. Excellent barista's (Great customer service)
3. Atmosphere (wonderful interior design)
4. location (across from Phoenix Art Museum

Giant Coffee is a great place to just get away and relax or meet up with friends.  Parking has never been a problem for me and I usually get a spot right up front.  I don't understand why some posts claim to have a problem with the barista's customer service because they are really friendly and take the time to get to know you.  I have never in my life met barista's this nice and I have been to a lot of coffee shops in my time.  Also just last week I saw one of my favorite barista's at Giant Coffee come in on his day off to get coffee and he ended up spending a few hours talking to regulars he knew.  WOW, that says a lot.  Ya this place is no Starbucks thank god... and they don't write your name on your cup and throw it at you the second you decide to sit down.  Phoenicians let me give you some advice... A coffee shop is a magical place you go to get away from your hectic life so try and slow down a little and smell the espresso.  The people who have a problem with this place are just intimidated by its awesomeness and need to go back to whatever Starbucks hole they crawled out of.,Okay, so I only had a cappuccino but it was the most divine cap I have had in AZ...ever. Forget they only take cash and may be coffee snobs-
The decor is great and I can't wait to try more of their offerings and sit at one of their uber cool computer stations.,So far - this",0.26608
Fair Trade Cafe,"Yummy lattes, gluten-free options, wifi...i am in love...,After visiting the Phx Art Museum, my friend and I were thrilled to find this little cafe with outdoor seating as we were strolling down Central enjoying the nice weather. The prices are reasonable, and they offer many discounts including 10% off for teachers. The cheesy potato soup was wonderful! I also really enjoyed the chicken curry sandwich, while my friend raved about his huge slice of quiche. And as others have mentioned, the staff was very friendly.,This is a solid coffee place, quiet enough for reading friendly enough for having  a meeting or just being by your self. Prices are good, parking can be a bit tricky during busier times. Not the best coffee I've had, but its still very good and worth a visit.,Coffee shop-perfection.  Friendly staff, great coffee, free wifi, great location (ten steps from a light rail stop), wonderful ambience, and delicious food.  They got everything right with this place; I laid out my criteria for what makes a great coffee shop in my review of Mills End Cafe, and Fair Trade achieves all of those standards, and more.,Okay, okay this review was coming. This is my coffee shop.

Yeah, I'm that girl, you know, ""medium iced coffee with soy?""

They've got some new people on staff, but so far they all seem awesome. This is my favorite neighborhood coffee shop. It has everything you could want from a local cafe without the self-righteous hipster attitude. (cough, Cartel, cough). Besides the quality of the drinks and food, the atmosphere is nice. They have free WiFi.

What I love most about Fair Trade is supporting the business. I have (newly-formed) friends who work there and love it. The management truly treats its staff great and really wants to cater to the downtown Phoenix community. The prices are good and comparable to any Starbucks, but the coffee is traded ethically and bought for a fair price, which makes me happy.

Psst... they also have poetry readings and open-mic nights.

The only thing I dislike is that Fair Trade started closing earlier :( I can't go there anymore when I need to pull an all-nighter.

Try it and love it.,Great coffee. Great atmosphere. Very nice people. Wonderful to get coffee somewhere other than a huge chain. Long live a hometown shop!!!,So after multiple opportunities to go to Fair Trade Cafe, I FINALLY went and loved it.  Why was I taking so long in going? Not sure. But regret it.

It was First Friday, so very busy and very chilly, so I went actually a few times in one night.  First run was with the veggie soup, that was fabulous-- I can't wait to try other flavors.  Second run was a plain coffee and it was  tasty, not bitter- I drink coffee daily and often find it bitter at a lot of places. Third run was a mint tea- can't ever go wrong with mint tea.  

Now coffee houses, in my opinion are based a lot on the employees/owners, the vibe and the other customers.  The employees were above and beyond kind and the vibe was cool and as the night went on, it got even more cool.  It was open mic night and people were reading poetry-- some better than others but my favorite was a humorous poet who had the whole room in stitches.   I've never been to an open mic poet night, it was interesting.  I was talking to my friend and I got shooshed and someone yelled ""MAN ON MIC!"" and I felt like a frickin' moron but whatever, I understand.  I was new-- I didn't know the rules.  Doesn't help that when I talk in general, I pretty much scream-- loud talker but that's because I come from a family of 4 kids and if you were quiet, you were never heard.  


So, Fair Trade is 5 stars in my book.,I know I just wrote a review for this place, but I just discovered even more to love about it.  I had known about their  quiches and pastries and went to go get some with an iced coffee on Sunday morning.  What do you know, they offer a real breakfast as well on Sundays from 8-12!  

I forget the name of the dish I had, but it was sort of like a frittata with sour cream and fresh salsa.  It was awesome.  And it was only like $5 and came with rosemary potatoes.  Mmmm.

I brought my dog with me and they were super cool about it.  They brought the food out to me in the courtyard and even brought a milk bone and bowl of water for the dog.,Pretty cool cafe with a mixed vibe.  Seems like a lot of the workers & patrons are feminists which is awesome (especially since I'm living in Utah right now with a SERIOUS dearth of feminists among other politically active people!), but on the other hand there is a pretty distinct yuppie feeling to the place - but that is probably due to it's downtown location.

The barista's were all very friendly & helpful. They pull good shots of espresso and are pretty attentive to details.  Odd detail I noticed and thought was pretty cool: their bathrooms are exceptionally clean, consistently.

There is a lot of local (assumption) artwork for sale in the cafe that is quite nice - adds a good feel to it having dresses, sculptures, etc on the walls that is not only pleasant to look at but available to buy.

PS - Free wireless.,Love the coffee and art here! Have been a regular since moving to AZ and the service staff all know my drink and always have a smile! Plus, in addition to all the usual suspects for dressing up your drink they offer stevia! They run great deals on Groupon so your dollar stretches. Stop in and get your coffee on!,Spinach and feta croissant, orange juice, free wifi with decent pluggage, nice environment, good yet non-intrusive music. Easy parking too! (Hey, this matters to someone from the Bay Area.),I like this place.  There's nothing particularly outstanding about it.  I'd rate any dimension ""fine.""  But, somehow, all together, it works.  Homey and relaxed feel to it.,I love Fair Trade for the studying space, the people and the sandwiches, unfortunately  not for the coffee. If you are looking for a place to get some work done and eat a snack with some iced tea - I highly recommend it.,I have been here 2x since moving down here from cali bay area. I am a coffee snob and I really fit in here. The staff is very cute and helpful.
The people in the shop remind me of the bay area.
I drink americanos and the beans being used are very robust and smooth.
The menu selection is nice for the food fair and I really enjoy the general atmosphere.

I strongly recommend this cafe!!!

Donkey-,I had to park on the side of the street to visit this place. I wasn't made aware( by a sign) that the garage parking are for Fair Trade customers also besides those signs denoting special purpose tenants only.  I ordered my usual ice coffee with measured instructions. It tasted good, typical and but not memorable. This was the only item I purchase and I would come back for something else to experience more of this place.

When I visited on the weekend, there wasn't a seat for me as it was mostly occupied by ""students"" or laptops users. The place sounded like a noisy cafeteria.  Fair Trade is located in a modern industrial design building, and the inside has a more corporate decor than striking to be different. Although they have groups meets here, the place I think is more attractive to workers and students. I didn't feel it was an exciting place or place to lounge.,Yay: good location -- close to me and easy to get to.
Yay: free reliable WiFi.

Meh: the coffee. Not falling over good, but not burnt up, heartburn-inducing Starbucks style either. 
Meh: the food. Now, granted, I haven't been for lunch, but the a.m. selection does not knock me out. I would think a place as hippie-dippie and crunchy granola as this would be somewhat into remotely healthy food. Instead there were lots of bagels, greasy croissants, etc. The only thing on my vegetarian, health-conscious radar was whole wheat banana bread, which was totally blah and not even really banana-y.

Boo: having to get a key to get into the bathroom. I understand the point, but as someone who will pee every hour for the entire duration of my stay, not cool.
Boo: crappy LOUD Lilith Fair-esque music. Sorry, I left my strap-on at home. Maybe at night when people are just hanging the tunes would be ok, but in the morning I saw lots of poor downtrodden souls like me hunched over laptops, books, or in serious conversation with someone else in a business suit... people who were actually trying to, you know, WORK.

As much as I want to support independent businesses, I highly doubt I'll be back... there's just too many other great places to go.,Over the past couple years of my life, I have spent way, WAY too much time at fair trade. Reading books and drinking coffee is like my 3rd job, and I prefer to do it at my neighborhood cafe. 

If I want drip coffee (which is almost always) I will go out of my way to come here. It's simply delicious. If I want something else I might go elsewhere, but nothing else in central/uptown/downtown Phoenix can compare to a Fair Trade Iced coffee. 

The barista's are sweet, the live music on Saturday afternoons is a joy, the community computer has saved my ass at least a dozen times, it's ""coffee with a conscience"", and it's a 2 minute walk from my apartment. Of course it gets 5 stars!,What happened to this place?  

They used to be so good, there were always nice and friendly baristas, the food was very simple, yet still very good.  But went in last time and I like to order the Veggie Hummus sandwich, but they forgot the cucumber and my bread stale and dry.  The sandwich was not worth my 7 bucks at all.  

Very disappointed Fair Trade.,When you're low-carb, low-cal, no MSG and lactose intolerant, where can you go for breakfast in a new place? We (Himself and I) were passing through town and came here specifically for the non-MSG menu items before we said our farewells to Phoenix.

What we adored: Free parking in the nearby shady garage, large sandwich portions, friendly staff, low prices. I enjoyed the house salad, entree size (see photo). Cool music on the stereo system. 

What we could've done without: Bluetooth Douchebag guy loudly talking to Suit Lady, full priced refills on iced coffee.

I encouraged Him to purchase a bag of beans to bring home. We would love to see non-mayo recipe options for the sandwiches on the menu. Consider it, please?

I'll come back on my next trip through town. Right now, Fair Trade and I are friends. FT and Himself are acquaintances. 

:: raises cuppa ::,This is a great little joint to catch a quick meal. They offer tons of options and I love that they are vegan and vegetarian friendly. Although I am not  a vegan or vegetarian, it seems as though all of my friends choose to live the lifestyle and as long as the food is tasty I'm always up for something new. 

This morning me and a mate, Cole decided to stop in for some breakfast. We both ordered the vegetarian hummus sandwich. I definitely recommend it however after 8 months in Australia, Im continuously disappointed with what us American's consider black coffee. 

When simply ordering a long black in the states, it seems to be standard to get a cup of coffee from the pot when what I'm really looking for is a double shot of espresso with some extra water. This being said, food is great but coffee not so much. 

I've been living downtown for only a number of days but am starting to love my community and plan on making this spot a regular breakfast destination.,I enjoy Fair Trade because it gives me an opportunity to stop for a drink while I'm riding the light rail from North Phoenix to Mesa.

The coffee is alright, not bad, but nothing that I crave. The tea is along the same lines. The food is rather costly and I would rather run up the street to Carly's to grab a sandwich. 

I do enjoy the service, which is always quick and knowledgeable. My drink is always made the way I want, which is the most important consideration. Fair Trade also has a frequent buyer program in which they keep your buyer's card on hand for you. I appreciate that. They provide enough table and outlet space for a plethora of computer users. Plus, as a teacher, I appreciate any place that provides discounts for teachers, police, firefighters, etc.

Overall, I am good with Fair Trade. I will always stop when I'm riding past, but I don't like it enough to go out of my way.,Good coffee and tasty snacks.,Fair Trade, I wanted to love you. I really did. I came back even after I paid almost $5 (including student discount) for my soy vanilla latte only to leave because it was too pack to find a comfortable seat. The downtown location brought me back and this time I was lucky to find a seat right next to the front door where I could see the Roosevelt portion of the light rail. Definitely the downtown feel. I ordered a soy latte and I almost asked for more espresso with my soy because it tasted more like coffee flavored milk than anything else. After a few hours of studying I ordered a turkey sandwich which wasn't too bad but couldn't make up for the lack of caffeine in my system. Sorry, fair trade but I tried. Until we meet again.,Better than any Starbucks u can get the staff is very friendly and it was located just steps from my hotel which was a plus they also have great ice cream that they sell until 2 in the morning great drunk impulse buy what sold me was the ice cream ""samiches"" made with freshly baked chocolate chip cookies definitely will be a regular stop on my future trips into town,You can't get any better than Fair Trade in my book. And here's why:

I work for a grassroots non profit organization. This will be important later in the story. 

I first discovered Fair Trade through one of the owners, who also happens to volunteer for the organization I work for. (Remember I said my job would be important to the story?) I came in a few times and was continually impressed with the friendly staff, great coffee, and overall great atmosphere. 

Because of my job (and lack of office space) I have a LOT of coffee meetings. Sometimes it's all I ever do. And FTC is a great location, and it's way cooler than Starbucks. So my coworkers and I definitely give them a ton of business with our meetings! 

The Sunday brunch is awesome, everyone must try the egg puff and the potatoes, they are to die for. It's a great way to spend a Sunday morning!

The free WiFi is also awesome when I need a Central location to work. Sometimes I refer to it as my office. 

Lastly, Fair Trade donated coffee to the annual fundraising event that our organization holds annually. It's just a wonderful testament to how community oriented the staff and owners are, and how great Fair Trade is for downtown Phoenix!,The coffee is fine and I like the fact that they feature fair trade coffee, which they now serve it in espresso cups rather than paper when requested. 

I was disappointed when a customer smoked indoors while sitting on the couch by the front counter and no one stopped him.  I thought that's what the outdoor tables are for...,Cute little place downtown, very good for a break, brunch, sunday breakfast. Food is decent and the atmosphere is not too crazy. Bring a laptop for the free WiFi and you're ready to go.

Have fun, be safe and good luck.,I have been here a few times, since I live in the apartments within a block's walking distance.  The food and beverages offered are some great choices, including delicious vegan brownies and a tasty veggie sandwich.  The tea was good as well. I have not tried the coffee.  The prices were about average for a place such as this. 

The free Wi Fi is nice, and I love how close it is to where I live. Supposedly there are small discounts if you live at the Roosevelt Square Apartments and/or ASU student, but I've mentioned that each time and have not received discounts. 

The seating can be variable, depending on the day/time that you go. I have found seating sometimes, but other times was at a wobbly table and ended up leaving (it was the only one available).  In the later afternoon/evenings, it can get a bit more crowded and harder to find seats.,Fair Trade? More like unfairly priced, as in, ridiculously LOW prices when compared to Lux, Lola, Copper Star, et al.

My espresso macchiato today was going to cost $1.20, but then the kind barrista asked if I was a ""teacher or student.""  When I said ""teacher"", she asked me for $.98.  I tipped over 100% and still had more money in pocket than had I gone elsewhere.

It tasted like $1.78.,3.25 stars.

Adequate coffee and drinks near my house and right across from the Central/Roosevelt light rail stop.  I'm working my way through the menu, and even though the psychoslow service is somewhat unreal, I'm never here when I'm in a hurry.

Are the frittatas gone?  The downtown location has supplied some lovely frittata dates in the Civic Space by the Goofy LED Boners for me, but I can't ever seem to get a luscious pair of frittatas shaken in my face at this location anymore.

The chai is very inconsistent from day to day, but I still walk here and have one a day some weeks.  The smoothies taste like they're made with sugary purees; I'd still rock one on the rare days when I don't give a rat's damn about high sugar consumption.  I like the frequent drinker card and the adorable filing system at the register.

Must try their biscuits and gravy.  Breakfast is nextest.,I am pleased with the service and quality of this place.

First of all, it is easy to locate-- especially if you are visiting downtown Phoenix and using the light rail for the first time (it's right across the Central & Roosevelt station).

The atmosphere is perfect for:
- studying/ reading/ internet browsing
- meeting with a friend for some coffee/tea/snack

They have an outside patio as well. Their drink selection is great. They have coffees, smoothies, teas, sandwiches, and other pastries. Prices were reasonable. The staff is definitely friendly and they are very efficient in how they operate. 

Definitely would go there again if I am in the Phoenix area. Loved it.,I love this place, I just wish it was closer to me!

Not only do they have almond milk, but they have gluten-free goodies. How awesome! They also offer Sunday brunch menu, so count me in for eggs and potatoes with my latte! They have so many baked goods, enough to satisfy any appetite.

I would come in and work here, the furniture isn't the MOST comfortable I've been in, and plugs are hard to come by with some tables, but it's such a great atmosphere that I don't even care. 

The staff is always so nice, what a great place to have a cup of coffee, a date, or a working session.

Park in the parking garage, except it gets a little busy on Sundays when the church parking is there too.,I love Fair Trade. That about sums it up. However, if I wrote this review a year ago, which I did but never posted, I would have given them 5 stars. I still love them though. 

It is located a stone's throw away from where I live and I can often be found there. I actually haven't sampled the coffee, I don't drink the stuff, but my husband enjoys it. I do love the iced tea, hot chocolate, and hot teas. The sandwiches are great and the baked goods are amazing, save the bagels. (They are from Chompie's) I love the filled croissants. In recent months, their quiches had begun to get really salty and they took them off the menu and replaced them with frittatas, which look exactly like the quiches. I actually asked where the egg was when I ordered my first one. Their Sunday brunch is great (love the chili cheese egg puff or whatever its called and the sweet potatoes mixed in with the side of potatoes is great!) when I don't feel like going out to a sit down brunch and just want to run and get something quickly, they are the only place in this neighborhood that provides that on a Sunday morning...there are no bagel shops or anything. What I like most about Fair Trade is that if you are there to do work you can literally sit there all day and be able to have lunch, unlike at other coffee shops where the food sampling is limited to various baked goods. With the soups, salads, and sandwiches Fair Trade really functions more as a cafe. 

Service is always friendly; however, lately it hasn't been as on point as it once was. I wonder if they sent the more experience people to the new location and have all the newbies at this location. The rotating art is fun and a great resource for local artists to get their work out there. The new furniture they have put in is a little out of place and does make it feel overly cramped and hot at times though. 

They participate in First Fridays and host poetry slams and sushi nights. They let me sit on the patio with my dog and bring her water and dog treats. Free wifi, free garage parking...does it get better?,Soy chai lattes, really good green tea, free wifi, open late, really chill and organic... that is Fair Trade. They have the best vegan brownies in the world.  
Parking can kind of suck but this place is my Central Perk.,I hear the Sunday brunch menu is revamped so I plan to drop in soon to try it.  The baristas are friendly, over educated (+++), and attractive.  There's ever changing art on the walls.  Free wifi and free parking in the private garage is another plus....and it's right at the Roosevelt light rail station.  The coffee is fine and I like the house salad.  Otherwise the food is a little too greasy-spoon for my taste, which lean savory.  There are plenty of pastries there  for the rest of you!,I really liked this place. The iced tea is great and you get free refills!

The decor is cute and inviting and the staff is very friendly. Free WiFi too!,I'm bumping FTC up to 5 stars.  I stopped in here today with my girls and they proved themselves to be not just a really good coffee house - they're a great coffee house.

Would you like some ethical business practices with that latte?  Actually it comes with everything you purchase here.  Connectedness to the local community?  Standard.  Quality products?  Ditto.

I spent a good part of the half hour or so I was here talking with one of the employees, Shane.  Great guy and he served up 2 chocolate croissants for my kids with great panache.  I even snapped before and after pics.

And I discovered they make toddy.  Next time you're here ask for your drink made with toddy instead of espresso.  Smoother, more robust and more caffeineyer.,I live not so close to Fair Trade, but I don't mind the commute.  The barista's are super chill and the coffee is always good.  The food is really good, too!  Shout out to Tricky for always being so nice!,I got one piece of pumpkin bread and a plain iced coffee... $7.11! 

7/11 is where I should've went. I could get a jackolantern to deliver pumpkin bread, and blow out my candle, for that price. This place is going in Lil Bootsy's litterbox.,I love this place.  You can always have a good time here.,I love any local business that supports local farmers by offering homemade food. I had a sandwich and a treat and both were very good. There is free WiFi and a relaxed atmosphere.,Mostly enjoy this place for its moral consciousness. I also like the coffee. Great americanos. I am a fan of its location, the lightrail stop is close by and it is under some great apartments.,If your like most folks and are tired of Starbucks. I must say this place is a breath of fresh air. They have great food, I have only tried their vanilla tea but let me tell you, it's the best thing since slice bread! Side-note, there is free wifi, the customer services is great also the atmosphere is perfect for meeting friends, getting work done and studying. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a change from your local Starbucks.,To quote Mr. Vincent Vega, ""That's five dollars? You don't put bourbon in it or nothin?""

This was my initial reaction to the price of the eternal favorite, the Fair Trade large iced mocha which after tax fetches a solid $4.87.  I recently moved to the downtown area and I'm ready to throw my money at the local shops.  I was also hoping I'd save a little by giving up the Starbucks Fourbucks experience.  So I was a little shocked to see the price of this staple of a beverage.

But let me tell you, ""This is a pretty f***ing good (iced mocha)!"" 

It is worth every. single. penny.  Don't take my word for it.  My punch card shows it all.  (Double punch Mondays??  Yes please.) I don't know what the secret ingredients or processes are in making this gem.  Honestly, I don't want to know.  Let's keep the magic.

On another note: Gentlemen, the last few times I've been to Fair Trade the place has been packed with the loveliest of ladies (on both sides of the counter).  I don't know if this is a marketing strategy, but it's working on me.

Good show Fair Trade! Cheers!,good coffee, friendly staff, good food.  they forgot to bring out the bagel I had ordered, but were very apologetic about it.  I will go here again.,I  liked Fair Trade Cafe.  The service was with a smile, the coffee was great and they cater to artists and crafters!  I was able to leave a stack of flyers to promote my jewelry business which is always a PLUS!  I will definately go back soon!,Last stop fo the day for me. I met Jack T. and Leslie here for some knitting. I had picked the place randomly and I am happy it was Fair Trade. They had a wonderful seating area to sit and chat. I grabbed a cup of tea. It wasn't anything special but amazingly, their water wasn't so hot that it overbrewed the tea. So many coffee shops use the hot water from the coffee maker. That water is often too hot for tea, and makes the tea bitter and oily as a result. 

I didn't eat there but the food looked yummy. There was a quiche in the bakery display that looked tasty. I definitely want to come back for some food. 

But best of all was the staff. So amazingly friendly, even at 8 pm. 

I'm sad I don't live in this area. The residents near here are so lucky to have such a wonderful place nearby. I've got to find more reasons to be in the downtown Phoenix area and spend time at Fair Trade.,Delicious pastries, good sandwiches, great drinks, free wifi, almost always open - this place is one of my favorites for a quick drink or a full meal. All their food is made fresh on site, and you can taste that.,I don't come to Fair Trade for their coffee, as it's kinda blah. 

But I'm happy to drink coffee there, because there are so many things that are FAR from blah about Fair Trade.

- super friendly staff and excellent service
- fair prices
- great daily soups
- good lattes
- yummy baked goods, baked on the premises
- free wi-fi
- very accessible meeting location for getting together with friends
- very close to the library, great for grabbing a book and settling in with a drink to read for a while
- very clean restrooms (a girl's gotta go after settling in with a drink!)
- resident discount for Roosevelt Square residents (10% off), though I rarely take advantage of it

My husband and I regularly go to Fair Trade to study, read and people-watch.

OH! One thing: Don't plan on hanging out during First Fridays unless you're prepared to pay a cover charge to stay there past a certain time. Most First Fridays they have an open mic poetry thing, and it's kindof annoying (at least to us). Despite being there for a few hours, and buying several drinks, we've been asked to pay the $5.00 cover charge or leave once these gigs start. That sucks, but thankfully it's not a regular occurrence.,Best coffee I've had in Arizona.  

I currently work in IT and need a remote place from home to get my work done.  Fair Trade is perfect.  The people are pleasent and I've always been treated with respect.

Come join me for a perfect cup. 

I love you guys and gals at FTC.  Keep doing it.,I'm a grad student who loves studying in coffee shops, but prefers tea. My favorite brew is the Mighty Leaf Green Tea Tropical. I have searched for months to find a cafe that serves anything even similar...and discovered today that Fair Trade stocks the real stuff. My life in Arizona is now nearly complete. (Now if only the girlfriend would visit from Cali more often),I was on the light rail today and spotted this coffee shop from the train, so I figured on my way back I would check it out. The place was really cute, with a great selection off coffee and drinks to choose from.

The place has tons of seating, including a bunch of comfy looking couches and chairs, along with tables and chairs if you wish to use them.  Several people were there surfing the internet, and I wandered in looking for some coffee.

Initially, I wanted a Mocha.  When I was asking the girl behind the counter about it, she said her expresso machine was broken, but she could substitute coffee for it instead.  I decided that I would rather just get the coffee instead so that's what I got.  She was really nice about it, and apologized for it being out of order.

While waiting for my coffee, the girl offered me a pastry in compensation for her machine being down. Whatever she gave me, it was awesome! It was chocolate chip something, and tasted divine! 

I was going to sit in the patio area and relax by the fountain, but I passed because the seats outside were already taken. I ended up hanging out on the couch inside, which was really comfy.  

The coffee itself was strong but tasty, and everything went well. I would gladly stop by again when I'm in the area or have time when doing stuff.  Go check it out, the place is pretty cool!,This is a cute coffee shop to have nearby. In the 3 times I've been here, seating has never been a problem, which is nice. The barristas have been fairly nice as well. On Sundays they have a brunch like menu, with eggs, bacon, biscuits and gravy, potatoes, etc. Nom nom.  

I take issue with the fact that they don't brew their own iced tea. That may seem trivial, but they are a cafe, and so I think it's a cop out. The music is generally good, it's usually too loud to get work done. I would explore more of the options in the area, since there seems to be a lot.,Corporate coffee has its place in the world, corporate wannabees don't. 
Try Lux, Copper Star... Starbucks.,I have tried this place a couple of times because it is conveniently located but I wont be going back.  The first time I went there were 4 people in line ahead of me and it took 15 minutes to get my coffee.  The second time I went I ordered a vanilla latte but they forgot to add the flavor shot.  The coffee was not good enough to make up for the bad service.,I'm not really fan of the Fair Trade system. I want to like it since it's a market approach, but from an economics perspective, it actually harms growers.

That said, I think coffee picked by child slave labor tastes best. The salt from their tears imparts that certain... je ne sais quios.

Not a bad coffee place. The baristas are cool. especially Geraldine who is also dangerous with a hula hoop, so better hope she is baristaing and not hula hooping, or you gonna git straight hooped, sucka. The coffee is tasty, they usually have a decent selection of tea, and their baked goods are fresh.  There is plenty of parking in the attached covered lot, and there's outdoor seating in both the front and back. The indoor seating is ample and comfortable. The tables and bathrooms are clean. It's downtown, and it's not Starbucks - IE the coffee is good and not burnt.

I'm a fan!,Tasty espresso, very friendly & welcoming staff, good atmosphere. Prices are competitive. Will definitely go back!!,There is something special about this little house. One of my yelper buds invited me over here but I was busy. The very next day my client that lives in the apts over the coffee shop invited me here. So two invites, two different people in two days means something right? 

I order up a capp and the flowerless peanut butter chocolate chip cookie. Ok gal, I thank thee!,This is a great place to have a meeting.  Best of all, lots of plugs for my lap top.  I love when you can easily find a plug.  The coffee and food was good.  The atmosphere was nice and calm.,Good coffee, good service.  I have gone three times, and each visit has been great.  

However, they are too expensive.  I am willing to pay more for quality, and I do, but they are startlingly more expensive than any other coffee shop I've been to in Phoenix.  $6 & change for a medium latte?  Serious?  That's almost $2 more than Lux, you guys.  (edit: that's before the tip! cman! by the time I ",0.316206
Elevate Coffee Co,"This is one of my coffee haunts. It's a good place to meet and talk through all the pressing issues of the world. I am confident that the cure for cancer will not be found in an obscure medical lab somewhere, but will be realized by a group of people meeting at a coffee house and talking about it over the third cup of tripple shot espresso. Who knows, it may be right here.,Star-who??  ;)

I love Elevate!  They have terrific coffee, knowledgeable and friendly baristas, an awesome atmosphere and yummy food.  What's not to love?!  

A+!,After a long night of entertaining guests there is no better reward than coffee for all the hard work done. And coffee did I get. I always passed by this place since I work in the same plaza where this place is located, but never had a chance to go into it. Its a very chic coffee shop tucked away from the busy main street and truly a gem if you decide to visit. As soon as you enter your senses are greeted by the smell of roasting coffee and an ambient atmosphere. Here is a break down:

Pros:

1. Comfortable: The place is littered with plush comfortable chairs ranging in shapes and sizes. However if you prefer wooden chairs there are plenty of those too. The music isn't over powering which gives no opportunity for it to become a distraction or annoyance. 

2. Staff: The Batista's where very kind and knowledgeable in their jobs. Also they are not afraid to chat with you for a tid bit while you order and pay.

3. Text Message Ordering: This thing is the bomb. All I have to do is text my order to them and pick it up at the store without waiting in line!

4. Rock Springs Pie: For those of you who are not familiar with who Rock Springs is, it is a small little diner in the middle of no where on the way to Flagstaff. They are known for their pies which, might I add, are divine. If you love pie and don't want to drive half way to Prescott, then i suggest you stop by here and pick some up! I suggest the Jack Daniels Pecan Pie!

Cons:

1. Busy: Sometimes it gets really busy in here and seats can be scarce, however don't let that deter you because there are always seats outside.

2. Food Time Limits: Some of their food are only made at certain times. For example, the crepes are no longer available after 8pm. 

Over all I fell in love with place which is a bit strange for a picky person like me, but this place really made an excellent first impression. I think this just became my favorite coffee shop, for now.,Elevate is one of the best coffee places in North Phoenix.  It's tucked in away in the Norterra Shops next to the Harkins Theater.  

I'm not a coffee expert but I think a good espresso requires the right ingredients, good equipment, and people who know what they are doing with both.  I'm SO glad I came across this place. It has a great atmosphere ~ great seating everywhere both inside and out, uplifting interior designs, cool tunes give a good vibe, and awesome baristas make delicious intelligentsia coffee.  They use Arabic beans from the world's premier growing regions and equipment that seems fancy enough.  Best of all~ they are giving 10 cents per cup of coffee they sell goes to provide clean water for a child in Africa!

They have very friendly and knowledgeable staff that doesn't completely change by the day.  They consistently produce perfect tasting drinks far beyond the quality you will find the large coffee chains in the neighborhood.

They also offer a variety of pastries, deserts, sandwiches and soups.  They offer live entertainment on certain nights and weekends.  It's a great place to rest, relax, build relationships with your friends!,Dropped in here one morning to get a latte and a sparkly blueberry muffin at about 8am on a week day and it was DEAD.  

But I bet this place is happenin' at night on the weekends.  There are a ton of seats, checkers games, books, magazines, comfy chairs... and it's huge so there's plenty of room so you aren't in someone else's space when you just want to friggen write a report.

I got the toasted marshmallow latte... yummy.  I kinda wanted it to be a little creamier, but it was still tasty.

I also had a sparkly blueberry muffin.  They get their muffins from someplace in Tempe who puts sparkles on their baked goods... and it really was good.,This place ROCKS! Very cool shop, large and roomy, lots of seats, nicely decorated, good vibe, decent outdoor area with additional seating.

They carry soy, almond and rice milk, which is totally awesome for a vegan like me that has a soy milk intolerance. 

They've got some vegan packaged bars and oatmeal options, which is pretty cool.

They've got a loyalty discount program, which is cool and you can even place your order via text message in advance! r0x0r!

I'd give em 5 stars if they started carrying at least one vegan baked good. Their entire baked goods case has zero vegan options.,Met my friend Jackie to grab a cup of coffee and ended up staying for hours!  It is a great place to relax with comfy seats and a great vibe.  We plan to go there one night after a movie to sit and relax while listening to the live music.  Very cool.  They have delicious sandwiches and their baked goods looked amazing!  

The baristas are so nice and helpful and very friendly.  The place is modern and inviting. They offer so many organic healthy choices.  It is located in Norterra close to the Harkins Theater.

Glad she suggested this place ~ we will definitely be back.,Great atmosphere this Friday nite. Nummy tea, great service. Excellent live acoustic work, Mr. Matt Beem ~,Lovely Staff! They are such sweethearts and say nice things on my cups! Their coffees and teas are delicious ! Prices for drinks are very reasonable too,Nice place to get work done when you're out. All the drinks are good. One star deduction because the counter help runs hot and cold.  Sometimes the service is great, other times they are more interested in talking to each other.,So perfect. The atmosphere is just spot on. I love going whether it's just to grab coffee and leave or if I am there studying or just want to chill. I love their Apple Harvest (?) salad. So delicious and beautifully prepared. Baristas are always very nice (especially Brianna!). Can't wait to hopefully become a regular and attend some of the live music events they put on every week!!,First time here love the atmosphere and free refills on regular coffee!,This is a great coffee shop. a little closer than my local starbucks. Sorry, don't mean to C.B. (coffee Block ) you starbucks, but the Ice Americano is great! and the atmosphere is awsome. they seem to really be into giving back to the community also.,I've been looking for a nice place to study for a while now and I'm glad I've found elevate. The atmosphere is relaxing and other than the chairs being relaxing, their marshmellow whipped makes for a pleasant surprise.,One of my favorite coffee spots and worth the 20 minute drive. They have a great selection of non-dairy milks ( almond, rice, soy) and gluten free baked goods. Great, comfortable place to work, read, or meet a friend.,I am disappointed that my experience here didn't match up to all of the great review this place has gotten, I was excited. I heard about Elevate from some people at work, and since my husband is a coffee fanatic, I thought we should definitely try it. The decor was awesome but getting to the counter was a different story... The 3 women on staff seemed totally and completely disconnected from their work. No smiles, no suggestions since it was our first time, just long faces and monosyllabic answers to my questions. I would understand if it was 1 person maybe having a bad day, or even if it were early on a Sunday, but it was 10 AM and it was all three of the women that we interacted with. 

On the positive side: I had a vanilla bean creme (no coffee) and it was very good, like a frappe but without the java kick. I also had a sausage breakfast burrito, which was really good (they have pepper-jack cheese which added a little unexpected heat to it.) 

My husband had an Americano which he said was good, but his Nutella & banana crepe had been microwaved, so it was chewy. He ate the other half of my burrito instead of finishing it.

I am not prone to giving bad reviews and because of the food they're getting a 3 instead of a 2, but the lack of personable service was very disconcerting and I don't think I'll go back for that reason.,Simple, cozy, modern design for a coffee shop. Plenty of loungy and plush couches and chairs. Open stage for live music. Staff was really friendly and upbeat on opening weekend (aug 20th-22nd) . . Plus free expresso drinks.

I wish I lived closer to this place - - because I know I would be a regular,GREAT coffee shop!  plenty of comfy chairs/sofas/ tables and outlets.  also free wifi is awesome!   coffee was pretty good, i got a 20oz americano for $2 and change.   Cheaper than Starbucks and the food looked pretty good too.  I knew I'd love the place when i first walked in and James Taylor was playing on the radio.   Also liked all the children's artwork on display around the shop.   A bit tough to find from the website, it's tucked to the right of the harkins movie theater and not directly accessible to the street.  you have to park and walk past the movie theater or park behind the movie theater to get to the coffee shop.  My iphone routed me 2 miles past the shop initially, but a quick friendly phone call got me right to the store :)  enjoy this independent NON Starbucks coffee house!,This is a great coffee shop for anytime of any day. During the evenings they have live artists come in and play, and it just has a really positive atmosphere.

There are tons of comfy chairs to sit and relax in, AND it's close to the parking lot, so its so easy to get to if you're in a hurry & just need coffee or if you want to stay and hang out.,Wow! This place is awesome! Live music and great service. I tried their green tea latte and was extremely impressed. Where did this place come from?!?! Love love this place!,I like coffee because I like caffeine, I like caffeine because I like to feel strung out but without the stigma associated with illegal narcotics.  Due to this fact of my life I always am trying new coffee places all over the country, even in New Zealand where if you order an iced coffee they assume you want ice, cream and on top of the ice and cream actual ice cream, that's just crazy to me.  Anyway back to Elevate, 1st off the place is huge, lots of seating that's really comfortable (couches and such) they also have a great menu of food items which all things considered could be good or bad.  Ive been to many a coffee shop with terrible food but Elevate ironically  ""raises the bar"" (GET IT HAHAHAHAH OH MAN THAT'S HILARIOUS, GOOD GOD I CANT STOP LAUGHING HOW ABOUT YOU? OH ITS NOT THAT FUNNY? yeah your right) and actually puts together some delicious food.  All their baked items appear to be made there and are spectacular as well as their sandwiches.  I had the french dip with blueberry coleslaw for the side.  What the hell is blueberry coleslaw?  I don't know but its F'ing amazing, so was the sandwich (ill post a picture in a minute).  Obviously the coffee is good too, I mean thats how they got me to go check out the place, its to me the level of coffee bean, really good not bitter like the hell that Starbucks serves *HATE STARBUCKS BTW*.  And they have a nice menu of different coffee options to satisfy any coffee lover, Elevate = Great :),Love this place.  I go to do my work during the day (never been there in the eve).  Like others have said the seating is great, atmosphere, vibe--none of the ""you're not cool enough to come in this coffee shop"" here.  I do miss Keenan, he was the BEST barista......  

Elevate has the best espresso in town.  Usually my Americanos have nice crema on top, although like one reviewer said, the counter help is uneven -- my husband asked for an Americano and asked them to be sure there was a lot of crema on the top, and the girl poured a whole bunch of milk in his cup!!  He told her to make him another one (I would have choked it down and been upset).  

Delicious pastries also!!  I've only eaten lunch there once and it was good too.  Can you believe blueberry coleslaw?!  

The character breakfasts on Tuesday mornings are adorable -- although I did think Dora looked a little creepy this morning with her huge hands, and Elmo was suspiciously quiet....,Love Elevate! Great place with a great cup of joe :) What I truly love is that they have tons of options that are great for non-milk drinkers (not just soy milk like some competitors). 

Perfect place to grab a cup, study or even listen to live music on a weekend evening.,This is just a great place to get a cup of coffee, some food, and get some work done. Plenty of seating, including comfortable chairs at the tables, and nice furniture to kick back on.

They make a pretty decent breakfast burrito too.,Super cool coffee bar with a great outdoor patio for little ones to run around!,This is a fantastic coffee shop.  There are tons of comfy couches and chairs, as well as tables to choose from.   The live music on Friday and Saturday nights is great.  The staff is very friendly and super accommodating.  Plus, they have worked out a deal with Harkins to allow patrons to take their Elevate beverage into the theater!,Great atmosphere!  It's next to the movie theater.  I love the lounge area, the live band, and other events that goes on in this place.  I love how it's always pack with people of all ages every night.  

Great staff!  Keenan, you're awesome!  Thanks for my cappuccino and croissant.  The cappuccino was perfect!,Wow what a place!! nice decor and the staff was pleasant and had great suggestions. Took the time to explain their menu and unlike damn strbks I could actually hear what she said and didn't have to YELL my order!! So relaxing this place. The whole experience is better than any and their macadamia, walnut I think muffins are to die for!! My wife had the cinnamon roll  and it was enough for a family. Hurry and go there or better yet right next to the theatre before the movie.,I've recently become a regular here. Every wednesday night they have an open mic. You never know what to expect because it's always something different!

The Baristas are exquisite. Always in a great mood and they make everything perfect!

Everything I've had here has been great. Also, the pizza is pretty good too.

A great way to spend a wednesday night if you want a little entertainment and coffee!",0.375789
Eba Cafe,"This place serves the BEST Boba Tea in the valley.,Spending a lot of my childhood in Canada led to a quick obsession with boba tea.

However, in Arizona, a really good boba place is hard to come by but then I found Eba a few years ago. Their drinks are so refreshing and as good as you can possibly find in this area. Plus, the boba come out just right, not too hard or chewy, which seems to be a huge problem for some places. I recommend the almond milk tea with boba, which is my personal favorite.

I almost cried when I thought they went out of business after they closed their old location but they ended up relocating so go to this one and try it out!,Looks like the owners have opened up iKitchen at Ray/Rural... will give it a few rounds  on food (never ate food at this location) before reviewing but they surely brought their extensive drink menu!,YAY, BOBA!  I lived in the Korea Town area of Los Angeles for 2.5 years and loved it.  While there I developed a serious Boba addiction, thanks in part to the fact there was a great Boba spot on every corner.... literally.  Phoenix area.... not so much.  In fact, after moving here and seeing how things were as far as diversity, I figured my Boba days were over.

Enter Eba.  My life is changed.  Not only are their teas great, the price is right... $2.97 for a 24oz, plus staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  I recommend the Thai tea w/ Boba or the Red Bean with Boba.

Ok, here's the best part which separates this place from every other Boba spot in the East side.... SOY MILK.  Yes, they have soy milk and don't charge extra for it!  Awesome.,This was my first time for Boba! YAY BOBA!!

It was surprisingly good!  I ordered a green tea with milk and sugar syrup with regular boba....I Loved the flavor of the tea and the boba was cool, chewy like a gummy bear but doesn't stick to your teeth.

Cute and comfy atmosphere with a ton of different ways to order your boba. They also have  a small food menu which I didn't look at but saw what people were eating and it looked pretty good.

And if you've gotten a little tipsy after all your Boba drinking they even have a karaoke machine!

I can't wait to go back!,I am totally addicted to this place. Tons of flavors of smoothies, and perfectly cooked Boba. Green Tea, or even Vanilla Chi - so far all the flavors I've tried have been fantastic.,It goes by many names. Boba tea, bubble tea... Well maybe just two names. It's really the texture that's more up for debate. Melty gelatinous gummy balls that are sproingy on the teeth is one way to describe it. Black phlegmatic chunks of mucous laden smokers lung is another. It's all about perspective.

I happen to like the gooey little pearls that collect at the bottom of milky green tea, and Eba Cafe is the best place in the valley to indulge. They used to be located just north of ASU and I would pop in before classes, until one day they vanished without a trace. I was adrift without my convenient bubbly study break fare, but as fate would have it, I was stuck in gridlock on Broadway and what should mine eyes behold? A bright red ""Eba"" in a strip mall across from the dairy plant. 

What a sweet reunion it was! Jelly goodness afloat in milky green or black tea with one of thirty-some possible flavors added!
 
The black and green tea are traditional stand-bys, but if you're feeling daring, try the wintermelon tea. It has no sugar added but the natural sugar is so incredibly potent that I couldn't finish a thimble full sample without experiencing the puckered, day-uuum-that's-sweet face. After you've chosen your tea, try to narrow down the flavor additives, red bean is a solid choice but watermelon is my ultimate trump card. Mango, taro and honeydew are also pretty tasty. Then decide if you want some kind of gelatinous goop added to your drink. They have several different types including boba and coffee jellies, which I've heard are great in, well, coffee drinks.

Eba also has some light lunch and munch options if you feel like nibbling. I've had the green curry chicken bowl, which is earthy with a nice spice, but the accompanying rice was a little dried out. If you're just there for a snack, try the brick toast with coconut. Delish! They also serve gelato, but between you and me, it looked kinda nast. Eba should just stick with what it does best, wicked good tea with lovely little snot balls.,Being a total Asian bobaface in a generally boba-deficient state, I adore this joint.  The chocolate mint smoothie is always on my mind if I'm in the Tempe area or passing through on my way north.  I dig my boba firm and chewy, so I always ask for the drink to be made extra icy to chill the little pelotas to ideal suppleness.  Eba has a pretty large menu and will gladly do flavor combinations.  They use the proper plastic seal on the tops of the cups so you can shake the living daylights out of the drink (as one should).  

Also, Eba has free wi-fi and is close to the airport; it's our favorite pre-flight stop to do a final check of email.,This was my first time trying boba, and it was delicious!  Eba has an amazing selection of drinks (and ways to prepare them).  I decided on tea+soymilk, boba with coconut flavor.  Mmmm!  It was sweet and creamy and wonderful.

The cafe itself is bright and welcoming.  I joined several other Yelpers there for Office Hours and we lounged on comfy couches.  In addition to food they sell a selection of gifty items too.

Is it sad to admit that I craved MORE later that day?  Yeah, that's right... if this place wasn't so far from my house, I might have gone back for seconds.,I met Gabi et al for Office Hours and it was a nice start to the day.  When I lived in Boston I would go into Chinatown for Boba....I have to say that Eba was much more generous with the Bobas than they are in Chinatown in Boston!

However, as far as the tea part went I thought my tea was entirely too sweet (passion fruit)....I mean there should be a slight flavor to it but this was very sweet.  I plan to try more flavors however so I will be sure to update on those.  They do have a ton of options though so there is plenty of room to explore.  I didn't realize until after I ordered that they have shave ice!  I loooove shave ice.  Its definitely another item on the list to try at a later date.

Eba is located in the strip mall that has Fast Signs in it in case you drive right by like I did and didn't even see it.....I'm not sure it has a large sign on the storefront.  

One of the big drawbacks for me is that Eba doesn't open until 9am.  I would love to be able to stop there before my summer classes to pick up a drink but with a 9am opening time its just not possible.,I'm ashamed that I invited someone to come here with me for our first time. 

I can get over the fact that it's in a strip mall and that the decor leaves much to be desired. But their boba tea was awful. I had banana with boba bubbles. We ordered edamame (which was fine...pretty hard to screw that up...as I'm sure they had a frozen package of it ready to go) and tofu. The tofu was the worst I've ever had in my life. And again, the drinks were below sub par.

Maybe I'm just spoiled by the boba tea I had back in IL. But I didn't think central Illinois was exactly a hot spot for asian treats. I would assume that Phoenix should have a better taste for those sorts of things. But based on Eba Cafe I'd say that's false.

I would not recommend this to anyone. Hopefully there are other boba places. Or maybe I really ordered the wrong thing. I'm always open to suggestion and correction. In the mean time, I'll go on thinking that this was a waste of my time and money!,Eba Cafe no longer has their own space-they have moved into the vastly underwhelming WikiWiki Hawaiian Grill in Suite #14!

Gone is the nice open sunny space they had, instead welcome to Meat Land w/unappealing seating and AZ Bro-Dawgs ordering some wings. 

However, while the space suffers, and so does the ambiance, a lot of the same food offerings are there and the same friendly Boba Barista is there to make my delicious Green Tea Soy Taro w/traditional Boba-YUM. The quality of the drink has not suffered and I am grateful the owner found a way to keep operating during this economic downturn, and while  WikiWiki is yawn worthy, I give them huge props for letting Eba move in, ...even with the weird Perfect Strangers vibe.,After reading all of the 5 star Yelp reviews that came before mine, I knew I would like this place!  I was looking for the best place to get my boba fix, and I think I found it!  

This was only my 2nd boba experience ever... I went with the green tea + soymilk boba; it was really good - not too sweet and just enough of the ""chewies"" as Amy D calls them or ""gummy bear consistency balls"" as several others referred to them!

Eba has a welcoming atmosphere and Susie (the owner) was sweet as can be... with free wireless and plenty of other snacks to choose from, you cannot go wrong.

I'll be back for sure to try some of the other chewable additions and flavored drinks.  For the health conscious, I noticed you can add protein to your smoothies and order your boba sugarless too!  Gotta love Eba Cafe!  FYI - Eba is located in a strip mall, I never would've noticed it if I didn't know about it from Yelp!,i love boba! this place is yummy with it being powder and syrup made, and the size and the price is reasonable! i love the watermelon and melon flavored boba, my 2 faves!, green apply is okay, banana sucks. taro is okay too.  it really depends on the flavor you are getting. and some have milk in it.  

in L.A. they make it with real fruits etc so it taste more refreshing and yummy, visit LA, must visit Chinatown bobas! yummy.  

their thai ice tea is also very good if you are into tea, its a peachy creamy kind of tea! so if you are really into tea you must try! 

it is hot when you go in there as if air conditioning is never on, & whenever i go there it's the same nice lady.,eba is good . 

old location was much better .

nice staff . nice place. 

check it out if you have not.,Oh, what a wonderful feeling... 

Picture this: A Young Woman moves from a city known for its Asian fare and bubble (boba) tea - only to discover her new Dessert Playland is devoid of her favorite sweet treat. We're talkin' about all types of bubble tea, including mixtures with different flavored jellies. We're talking Boba Heaven. So, imagine the vast disappointed of said Young Woman when she realizes she's traded her Asian District fare and Boba for Mexican Food Mecca and Horchata. Not that there's anything wrong with any of this... except a world without boba is a sad, sad world. 

Enter Eba. 

When I stopped here the other day for the first time, I had very low expectations. I was imagining limited options. Oh? Boba Tea of only milk and tapioca? Bummer. Little did I know that Eba is the real deal.

I walked up to the register. 

Me: ""Do you have coffee jelly?""
Owner: ""Yes.""
Me: ""I love you!"" 

I jumped for joy. 

I ordered an iced coffee latte with coffee jelly. Talk about a blast from the past I never thought I'd have again. (Let alone find in Phoenix!)

Eba is now - by far - one of my favorite places in Phoenix!,I've been a regular customer at the EBa! Cafe for years.  I take everyone I know here to try it!

Best Product:
Their drinks, by far.  My favorites are their flavored iced teas with boba.  The coffee drinks are good, but with all the good coffee shops in Tempe, I'd never pass up an opportunity to get a boba tea here.

What is BOBA?
If you've never had boba, then here's what you're missing-- you basically get a large scoop of oversized tapioca balls stirred into your drink.  They settle to the bottom, where it looks like you've got brown bubbles sitting at the floor of your cup.  As you slurp through your oversized straw, they come up with the iced tea, drumming at the roof of your mouth so you have to stop and chew every now and then.  They're the consistency of little drowned gummi bears, and can seem VERY weird at first, but if you're open-minded enough to try it, you might get hooked.  (I was determined not to like them, at first.  I got to the point where I went back twice a day to get more.)  They're completely vegan and don't taste much like anything on their own.  After a few minutes, though, they start to absorb the flavor in the iced tea around them.  So, it's like getting a drink and a snack in one.  Be careful not to take them home and refrigerate them overnight, though... they tend to dry out in the middle.

Heads up to new boba drinkers:
The cup will come to you with a sealed plastic top (to prevent spillage).  Don't try to peel it off... it's really stuck on there.  Just use your straw to punch a hole in the top of it.  That's what they're made for.  Be careful picking it up after that, though... the cups are sometimes thin enough to squeeze when you grab them, forcing the tea up through the new straw hole and all over you.  Take a few slurps before trying to move it around.

Flavors and Mixers:
All iced teas start with either a green tea or a black tea base.  After that, you choose your flavors to add.  My favorites are the peach, chai spice, ginger spice, pumpkin spice (seasonal), wintermelon, almond, chocolate, and sometimes banana milk.  The good thing is that the menu suggestions are just recommendations... you can custom-mix your flavors however you want them.  For the drinks that require milk, they use either soy or almond milk (I don't remember which), so even non-dairy folks can enjoy the whole range of flavors.  You can also substitute honey for the sweet syrup mixer, or even just opt out of the sweeteners altogether.  They'll prepare it however you like it.

Other menu options:
* In the middle of a Phoenix summer, their ice crushes and snow bubbles are amazing.  They basically take their boba teas and turn them into boba icees, with the same range of flavors available.  The ice crushes are without ice cream; the snow bubbles are with ice cream.
* Their hot teas (not used with boba) are loose-leaf scoops in very cool little decanters, but they only have a few different kinds of tea to choose from.
* Coffees and coffee drinks are very good.
* Gelato is tasty.
* The shaved ices are the same as I remember them from childhood, but I didn't like the red beans added to it.  They got too mushy and flavorless compared to the icy goodness around it.
* The brick toasts are wonderful, and the other food usually comes in small portions, so they're good for a snack.
* I don't think they mind if you bring in food from other establishments, as long as you patronize their business and clean up after yourself.

Service:
Suzi, the owner, is amazing.  She's in there all the time and is extremely friendly and helpful.  The other employees she hires all stay around for a while, which means that they enjoy working there.  They all know what they're doing and will re-make your order if they screw it up.  Not that they ever have!  They're wonderful!

Decor:
Their new-ish location on Broadway doesn't have the same mom-and-pop homemade feel that their old location on Forest did, but it's clean and cute, anyway.  There is seating available at tables, at the counter, or on couches in the front lounge area.  There is a TV in there that is sometimes on, so it can either be a good place to study or way too distracting, depending on your timing.  They'll turn the TV off if you ask.  Wireless is free for customers, but not for leeches.

Specials and discounts:
* There is a box of ""buy-10-get-1-free"" cards by the cash register.  If you get hooked, you'd be amazed at how quickly those go by.
* Sometimes, there are coupons on the rack inside the Sub Factory, which is in the same shopping center, a few doors down.
* There are also seasonal coupons online at: http://www.ebacafe.com/

What I would change:
* I'd love to see a decaf iced tea available for mixing.
* I'd love to have more comfy lounge space and fewer fluorescent lights (the only reason they keep them on is to follow safety codes until they get new lighting installed).,OMG!!!!!!!!!  I CRAVE boba.  Whenever I go visit my sister in the OC, we go everyday.  I have been looking for one since my last visit, Thanksgiving.
I walked into Eba and found...HOME!  I was so excited I nearly peed my pants!
They have a huge selection of drinks...tea, iced tea, milk and tea, etc.  You can choose either green or black tea.  Then, there is a wide range of ""chewies"" to add.  I, of course, go the boba.  I think I said ""boba"" at least a dozen times in there.  The entire time I am there, I'm on the phone with my sister, asking her what I order out there.
So, I ordered two of the biggest chocolate-black tea-and-milk boba.
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
I am playing Powerball today.  This has to be a good sign!,Eba cafe is amazing. The boba tea here is some of the best I've had, and it's so reasonably priced. I also love that they take cards! It seems every other little asian tea house takes cash only, and who the hell carries cash on them? They have a large menu of food, as well as tons of different drink options. They also sell gelato, lots of little random knickknack items, and Eba clothing. Oh - another great plus, they have punch cards! The perfect way to reward all of us boba addicts. 

Anyhow, this place is great. It's laid back, they have better hours (then that ""other"" boba place ;) ), and the owner (?) is super friendly. Not to mention it's even CLOSER to my place than that ""other"" boba place. Yay!

*If you are unaware of the ""other"" boba place, feel free to check out my Lollicup review(s). Support Eba!!!,So, boba isn't that novel if you're from an area with a bigger Asian community.  For me growing up and in college, boba was everywhere.  I never really got into it, so I don't have a seasoned boba palate, but I do know a good boba cafe when I see one and Eba is the real deal.

The little details here struck me as legit.  

* The boba flavors and extras are extensive - probably about 50 or so different flavors and way to order. I opted for the vanilla green tea complete with little tapioca balls at the bottom, which satiated my (at the time) liquid diet.
* Hot food lunch offerings. When I met Gabi and other Yelpers I noticed I could have even had a full-on rice chicken curry lunch.  
*  But the icing on the cake was the karaoke set in the corner.  Hellz YES, how authentically Asian -- Karaoke when you're sober!!  Oh the horror, good thing no one spiked my boba otherwise I would have been strutting on the table singing ""Humpty Dance"" by Digital Underground much to my and your dismay.

I'm liking you Eba.  I'll warn you next time so you have sufficient time to confiscate the aforementioned karaoke machine.  I will be back.,I love this place but my waistline cannot afford frequent visits!  

I love boba drinks in all forms and sizes!  My favorite is a mango smoothie with lychee jelly.  The small is enough for me...once I got the largest size and I swear I was ill from carb poisoning! hee hee

The last time I went, I had taro with boba and it was so good I wanted the large!  but no...i stuck with the small.

i reserve a star because they don't have spicy popcorn chicken!  It's the ultimate companion for boba!

My rec is go and be creative for a fruity, chewy, icy treat!",0.226334
Dutch Bros. Coffee,"I will miss you my fair, friendly, caffeinated friend...sniffle, sniffle. 

Good night, bad night, late night, good morning, bad morning, is it morning morning... this Dutch Bros is there for me and will be for you too. 

Next to ""customer service"" on wiki, you will find a picture of the staff. Simply amazing. Most of the time, I never had to mention my order, they had it ready when I pulled up, as well as some friendly banter. After making this my local for over a year...I felt part of the family. 

No burnt drip, just great americanos, excellent blended coffee drinks, and everything in between. 

Whether I ran, drove, walked, or crawled, this Dutch Bros was there to pick me up. As I head north to a new home...I will miss you my friend...but don't forget me, I promise to stop by.,The only good thing about this place is the guy working there was really nice:) oh and you can drive through. 

The bad.
THEY DONT EVEN HAVE COFFEE!!!!!! WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Its 2 shots esspresso and milk, wtf. 


It tasted very very burnt and had no flavor other than burnt. Sadly starbucks might even be better:(,I was recently invited to join the Dutch Mafia by two really really nice baristas at Dutch Bros. Coffee. I was concerned that there would be some sort of ""coffee in, coffee out"" ritual that would require my participation, but I was assured that I had nothing to worry about. And that is how I became a card carrying member of this organization. Also, this card gives you one free beverage after you purchase 8, so I would recommend joining the ranks of the Dutch Mafia. 

I am not much of a coffee connoisseur, as in I enjoy the instant shit that is provided by my place of business, so you can disregard my opinion. However, I love the coffee at Dutch Bros. Just a plain old cup of coffee is really tasty. 

They are also happy (like really happy, not faking it) to accommodate any other requests that you have. Once I asked for a half coffee half steamed chocolate milk (delish, bee-tee-dubs), and I got just what I wanted. They are even willing to experiment for you too, like the one time I got a kiwi-pineapple Italian Soda. 

I highly recommend stopping by for a drink if you ever happen to pass a Dutch Bros. If anything the uber nice beverage specialists will restore your faith in a kind-hearted humanity.,I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but I do love their chai tea. This is a great place to go for a quick meetup with a friend, or a drink on the way to school, work, etc. Every person who works here has a fantastic personality for my tired, groggy, sometimes crabby self, and it really does make my day. I love that the drinks are made to order, and you really feel like the staff is truly happy to create you a delicious drink. I want to go back today now that I wrote about it!,***WARNING, READERS DECRETION IS ADVISED***

Hot Lips!!  Ouch! 

Wow, I've not had a chance to try Dutch Bros before after driving by them many times due to the long lines.  Last week I wasn't in a rush so I pulled in behind four other cars thinking my wait for caffeine would be a while. To my surprise the wait was only 5 mins! The barista dude talked me into trying their monthly special, Irish Latte ~ silky blend of Irish Cream, milk and coffee.  I ordered it sugarless with 2%, no problemo.  The service was excellent! Fast, friendly and he gave me a frequent flyer card for my future trips. He explained how they roast their own coffee and they offer lots of other options ~ smoothies, soda's and juice.

My coffee smelled awesome and I could not wait to take a sip.  But wait a minute... Apparently Dutch Bros uses a coffee cup lid I'm not familiar with.  I looked at it and immediately thought about my son's ""sippy cup"" when he was a toddler.  This thing has a ""nipplessense"" feature about it that has a large hole!  So I stared at it for a while and starting laughing my face off, LMFO, and thinking about two iconic actors of the early 90's that imparted so much wisdom on our youth at that time ~ Beavis and Butthead!  

Beavis: ""that coffee lid looks like my old sippy cup""
Butthead: ""what do you mean?""
Beavis: ""it has a nipple...""
Butthead: ""uh huh huh huh.. you said nipple, uh huh huh huh...""

After I regained my composure, I smiled really big and took a sip of my Irish Latte from Dutch Bros. Ouch! Hot Lips! It took me a little while to figure out how to drink my coffee without burning my lips in this coffee lid.  The coffee was smooth with the perfect balance of sugarless Irish Cream and 2%. It was wonderful!  After it cooled down a bit I was able to enjoy my latte without burning my lips on the ""sippy cup"" lid. The large hole in the top of the lip was made for peak coffee guzzledge, after it cools down : -),great coffee--great servers.

make sure to get their text specials.,Dutch Bros is an outstanding coffee joint.   This Oregon company rocks it in AZ! So glad you are here!  Always great service and great strong coffee. Check em out!,Always good service and coffee.. never disappointed,their iced double torture is like crack to me! they were featuring infused red bull- i got pomegranate, which was good but not worth the $3.75 price. since it's not close and i adore the gold bar baristas, i'll stick with them..,YAY for Dutch Brothers!  I love the blended vanilla chai!  It is awesome and their breakfast bars taste like cookies!  YUMMY!  I do not drink coffee so it is great that their chai is great!  My son loves the strawberry smoothies and the chocolate chip muffin tops!  The people working their are always so happy!,Thumbs up Dutch Bros! 

It has come to my realization that I've been frequenting this place about twice per week since the sweltering heat began. 

I must say... they're stuff and they're staff is not bad. I'm a big fan of the blended Kahlua Kicker. I'm an even bigger fan when I get this drink for free, which happens as often as my visits here. You should try it. 

Despite the long line that forms during the nighttime, the gregarious guy with blonde hair never forgets to entertain with a liqueur bottle trick and good conversation. 

See ya!,The Girls were Awesome!!! They know how to Share The Love!

And the Coffee is Great!,What a refreshing business. I have my entire office getting their Joe there weekly. Smooth yet bold coffee straight up. In the afternoon, a Kaluha(sp?) Kicker iced fits the bill.
Easy drive thru and a small patio area to relax if you have the time.
Great people, great location, great coffee= Great!,I am generally against going and spending so much money on coffee but this morning I decided to treat myself.  I will say that the girls genuinely put a smile on my face. Being in Customer Relations, if I could get my staff to be half as excited and cheerful I would be delighted. The coffee was good but the staff was great.,Let me just clarify, I am not a fan of Starbucks there coffee is bitter, and way too much work to order early in the am. If you are, this may or may not help you. 

I LOVE Dutch Bros! 
Coffee is yummy and still gives me a kick. Prices are good, sign up for the occasional text msg to get additional deals, but if you forget what they are the baristas will tell you and give you the deal, they have punch cards which are way more simple the the card/balence/reload thing at SB. Baristas are FAST there may be a line of cars but I've never waited more the 5 min. Baristas are pleasant, they have good memories, and are all friggin' pretty (males and females) what better way to wake up in the morning! AND they are the exactly the same other times of day, I have odd days off and the experience is always the same. There is a reason the tip jar is always full. :),I'll admit it. I'm a coffee snob. 
After beginning a Starbucks Boycott last year (they used powdered coffee in just about everything other than their brewed coffee) I was starting to get lonely. 
On our way to Matt's Big Breakfast, my mother and I pulled in to Dutch Bros so I could try it out. It's right on my mum's way to work, and she recommended the four-shot Double Torture. It's like crack in a cup - in a good way.
I've since waned from my usal 4DT, but you know what I like about Dutch Bros, even more than the coffee? The service. I do not mind paying a little extra when I get treated the way I do at Dutch Bros. They ask you how you're doing, what you're up to, and they remember what you tell them so next time they ask, ""How'd you do on your Forensic exam?"" It makes you feel better! 
Oh, and they have a (drum roll please)... A PUNCH CARD THINGIE! 
For every ten coffees you buy (no matter the size) you get a little neat-o stamp on your card and after the ten, you get one (whatever size) FOR FREE!!!!!! FREE!!! FREE!!!! There are so many size restrictions on punch cards that I nearly squealed when I realized that I didn't have to pay extra for my large iced ER 911. I'm a college student. ""Free"" is my favorite word.

So go, my brothers and sisters! Go and have coffee that will make your morning caffeinated! Go and be treated wonderfully rather than crappily at your local Starbucks that you pay for powdered coffee! Go and get your real, roasted-bean goodness in a cute cup that has flowers on it! GO!
(...I've been watching too many Civil war movies in History...)
But seriously. Go. Get a punch card. Join the Dutch Mafia so you get specials emailed or texted to you, along with... COUPONS!,I LOVE Dutch Bros! They have great coffee, great prices and their employees are always friendly! 
They have a great selection of drinks (ask for their secret menu) that are super yummy! I highly recommend trying one of the custom drinks...the B-52 (sometimes known as the Orange Kicker?) is my favorite!!,This coffee is the antithesis of Starbucks - mild, inconspicuous, somewhat watery. I'm not complaining. It's not bad, and if it is wasn't for the awkward location and impossibly perky and chatty hot blond chick*, I might even go back more often. 

* You're really cute, but asking me if I'm on my way back from church on a Sunday morning is just TMI.,Always a great cup of coffee and the nicest people ever work there,I am not often in this area as a general rule... but my daughter live pretty close, so I always make a detour into Dutch Bros Coffee! 

I just filled up my first punch card so now I get a FREE coffee next visit! Yay!

I always get the hot Latte Breve... so much BETTER than Starbucks!

Highly Recommended!,Good 'Ol Dutch Bros! The coffee dude was cool and friendly. He was super talkative and the coffee was good. My bff was happy to see this place along our route. Thanks Dutch Bros for good coffee.,This Dutch Bros had some of the best customer service I've ever seen from a young guy working on a holiday (Memorial Day). I ordered an Americano which was excellent and just the right proportions. My wife had a soy chai latte which was just a little too sweet, but still good.
Overall, it was an experience I would recommend, and it's staying on our list of go-to places as we explore our new neighborhood.,This place has it all over ""thee-coffee-corporation-that-shant-be-named""... cheaper coffee which tastes miles better, text coupons and deals usually once a week or so, a frequent buyer card (buy 10 get 1 free, and don't forget double stamp Tuesday!), but what sticks out to me the most is the employees. Always friendly, which is nice, but more importantly...  *gasp!* completely competent (a rarity these days).  They always deliver spot on, and are really cool to boot. I will never, ever go anywhere else as long as these folks are around!,I'm a big fan of this place. So far they are my favorite coffee addiction.,I love Dutch Bros. Coffee!  Their drinks are tasty, the baristas are friendly and it's really convenient.

They have excellent prices too.  It seems like I never have to pay full price for my drink.  Whether it's happy hour, coupons, punch cards or daily specials it seems like I always get a great discount.,The coffee is so good it made me curse out loud. Hot dayum! I ordered the large carmelizer which was just the right sweetness with an edge.The large comes with 4 shots.  I dont know what's in this coffee but I became giddy with happiness half way through the cup. The menu is easy to read and the staff is helpful.

This coffee must have some kind of zing to it., because I drank a cup in the evening and when I got home I worked out for 45 minutes, and worked on some office work for 3 hours...all on a Saturday evening.   Does anyone know of any good night spots around here?  Woo hoo the night is young!,Where's the caffeine?!   Decided to stop and try their coffee after reading the rave reviews on Yelp.  I'm a die-hard Peet's drinker and need my coffee strong, bold but not burnt .   I don't order fuffy-drinks like mochas, lattes, blah, blah, blah - I just want a good cup of strong Joe.  

Results - disappointing.  Coffee was very very very mild and watered down.  I guess I'll have to continue to stick to brewing my own.

Two stars for friendly service.,My most favorite place to get coffee---I love their Americano-style drinks (black, iced only for me; save the sweets for someone else), and their awesome employees! I seriously want all of them to come motivate my staff with their infectious, outgoing demeanors! They always brighten my mornings, and now that they are no longer on my path to work, I sometimes wake up early just to drive five miles out of my way to stop there first. The company motto is one I hope to adopt for my team, as it has clearly impacted their staff and business; I recommend and share their motto to my fellow service-industry providers constantly. These guys are top notch!!,Gosh, this place makes me happy! I must admit, I've driven past numerous times and never thought of satisfying my caffeine fix here. But, the other day I thought, what the heck? It's a drive thru, if nothing else I didn't have to leave my air conditioned car to get a cup-o-joe.

So, I pulled up and was greeted by two extremely cheerful people, just enough so that it wasn't intoxicating. They graciously helped decode my mumble jumble of requirements for caffeinated perfection.  I ended up with an iced skinny white mocha and was very pleased!  

This establishment is worth trying! The employees are helpful, the prices reasonable, the service quick and the coffee/espresso delish!,Love this place - my boyfriend and I used to go everyday before relocating out of town. Super friendly, upbeat staff - that was not faking it!

I am very picky and they would remake my drink whenever necessary. 
They knew our names - knew our drinks and would have them ready for us by the time we got up to the window. 

I already miss this place!,I agree 100% with the above posts!!!!,The guy working the stand was super nice and fast and the convenience of the drive-thru was great but I have to be honest and say I've had better coffee. The coffee was also made way too hot and I wasn't able to drink it for a long time after I had driven off. I'm also not a fan of the lids they use - the mouth piece was awkward, like I was performing on it whenever I took a drink. However, all that aside, if I worked in this area, it would be a great place to grab a quick cup of coffee and it's always great to support smaller businesses like this. I also liked that they had a wide variety of drinks different from the usual Starbucks menu.,I drive by this place every morning on the way to work. Its a very cool place to stop, even with 4 cars in front of me I don't feel like I waited in line like I did at a Starbucks drive-thru, because once you pull up to the window there are always super happy baristas happy to take your order and talk to you while they make it. I walked up once and saw that their coolers had Dutch Bro stickers on them and since I always talk about this place I asked how much they were, they trew a box full of stickers in front of me and told me to pick out what I wanted. So now I promote 24-7. Oh and for sure get the punchcard for free drinks and sign up for the email/text list because they always have specials.,I am a way more frequent visitor of the bell rd location, but sometimes I have to travel downtown for work. When I do, I make my route pass by this place because I have to have dutch bros.  The guys at the bell location are pretty familiar with me by now but these guys still treat you as if you are there best customer. And it's the best coffee I've ever had.,This is the best coffee in the valley, oh so smoooooth.    Friendly people working here who I suspect are required to ask about your day but they do a good job acting interested =).    

I stop by here every time I hit the St Vincent DePaul in the same parking lot.    

Support the local guy, down with ""big bean"",I have to admit . . . I'm sort of pissed off that I seem to have become addicted to this place.  The last thing I need is another $3.00 per day habit.  However, as far as drive-through coffee goes, this place is about as good as it gets.  The coffee is so piping hot that they offer an ice cube should you need one; it smells heavenly and sips smoothly.  The cup-lid is strange at first - like a child's sippy cup - but it's part of their shtick and doesn't interfere with one's enjoyment.  I've only had their Dutch Coffee, but do so a few times a week now, and I must say it knocks the socks off of any drive-through Americano.,simply the best..staff is awesome and coconut mocha ROCKS!!!  Generous deals..great concept and franchise...they kick Starbuck's A**!!,If you like sweet starbucks drinks you will LOVE this place. They have a great selection of drinks you can order either hot, iced, or blended. And they are cheaper than starbucks too! Even if the line is a little bit long they are quick. And the staff is beyond friendly. I swear they must seriously love their job! I would recommend the annihilator.,I loved this place!  I wish we had them on the east coast!!!  Normally I would grab a Dunkin' coffee, but the line was too long one morning, so decided I would try here instead!  What a great choice.  
Just a small place, but has some great coffee!!!  (Love the Coconut Mocha coffee!),Better than Starbucks anyday! 
The staff encourage their customers to get creative and provide new drink suggests to add to their list such as ""The Annihilator""..
My personal Favorite: ""The Cookie with a little raspberry"",Good coffee, GREAT service.  Every time I come around in my old beat up car that hasn't been washed in a year making all the noise so that I can't hear a word on the speaker, they STILL treat me like I'm an old friend and it's a pleasure to see every time.  

How can you say no to that?!?,LOVE THIS PLACE.  drive thru, get your fix, and the staff are insanely nice.  I don't know how they find such awesome young people to work there, but they are the best.  And they give out dog treats; my dog loves driving through!

BTW, there is a Starbucks literally a few yards from my house, but we drive 13 blocks just to get Dutch Bros.  SO MUCH BETTER!,Yum! So good the coffee here is really sweet and good :) In college in Cali I remember getting the 6 shot 911 and it worked I will be back for a all nighter,finally! my good looks get me somewhere! free coffee the other day courtesy of the foxy chick working the stand solo that morning. oh the hectic life of a working college student, and i need a quad dutch bros to get me through those dry mornings.

not to mention tons of coupons in the mail and a text subscription scores you great deals like $2 tuesday and every time a new dutch bros opens, the drinks are 2 bucks too. 

i guess capitalism has its perks.,Went for the first time today. Iced latte doesn't compel me to return. Menu seems cutesy, more like a Dairy Queen than an urban cafe.,Darn this place.  I wasn't a big fan at first.  Their drinks are good but they serve iced drinks in paper cups, which I find annoying.  But the kid likes their smoothies and the fact that they give her a lollipop and a whipped cream dollop on her straw.  So we go.  THEN ONE DAY.... wait for it.......... we order the Green Apple Smoothie.  Wow.  Wow.  Green Apple, Caramel and, if you really want to go over the top, whipped cream.  Now, all of their smoothies are super sweet treats.  But the Green Apple thing is different and wonderful.,The most sexy cup of jo on the face of the earth and lovin' us right back. This is a quick and easy stop off on the way to the daily grind. Thank You to all the faithful that have kept the coffee flowin' and kept the party goin'.,Employees are always super nice and amazingly fast. Huge line today and one of the employees ran out to the cars, took everyone's orders and MAN, did they make that line go fast!  Big big wow!  Loved my Annihilator :). *tip: make sure you bring cash to tip. They are worth tipping.,Not only is the coffee great tasting and the chai delicious, but the friendliness and customer service is awesome.  My friend frequents this location (every morning before work) and when he's needed a ride due to his car being dropped off for work done I have driven him here on the way.  To attest to the quality of the place, he drives daily to this location despite the fact that it's about 15 minutes (without traffic) past his workplace - where they greet him by name and have his usual orders memorized.

I have enjoyed the freezes, coffee, and chai (which is my favorite).  Drinks are full flavored and although their menu is limited, they have something for pretty much everyone.  I haven't tried any of their food items, but he does get a muffin in the mornings which looked pretty good.

It is a small location on the corner with a drive-through and a side window for those able to park and pick up their coffee in their limited lot, but it's friendly and has a very pleasant atmosphere.  When I'm craving a nice spiced chai, I head over to this location even though it's past some other coffee shops for the flavor, consistency, friendliness, and service.,I don't know how this or ANY Dutch Bros. Coffee gets anything higher than 2 stars. Their employees have always been very nice and friendly, but I doubt most of them know anything about coffee. Seriously? How does anyone drink this stuff?

On several occasions my HOT drink was luke warm at best. I ordered a vanilla latte once and it was mostly vanilla. I only added syrup to distract me from how bad the coffee tastes and ended up with a cup of luke warm vanilla.

I guess it's only redeeming qualities are that the staff are nice and you have the convenience of not having to get out of your car and getting everything through the drive thru. That isn't enough for me though. Thank you, Dutch Bros. employees, for being very nice. But I won't be returning to this location (or any of them for that matter) anymore.,There's not a lot that I can really say about Dutch Brother's coffee. That's not by any means negative; their drinks are really quite good. Their menu is just rather limited. I was hoping they would have at least a small selection of pastries or even a yogurt and fruit parfait...okay, okay I know.  It's a drive through only coffee shop and a fruit parfait would not really be practical, but that doesn't keep me from wanting it any less!
The most recent drink that I tried was the Annihilator which is a creamy coffee drink of mocha and macadamia nut. Being that it's June and I live in Phoenix, I got my drink iced. Like any other drink I tried it was the perfect strength and lacked any signs of bitterness. It was smooth and tasty and the drink to coffee ratio was perfect. It lasted a 20 mile drive to work and all the through till my first break with tasting watered down at all.,YUM!

I can't even taste the coffee...their mochas taste like chocolate milk. And I can guarantee there is some caffeine in it because I don't go though withdrawls during the day. And I don't even need to get out of my car to get it? SIGN ME UP!,Love this little place. As a Dutch I love all the imagery. You ain't much, unless you are Dutch. Told the girl that was working that last year, when we had a car fukll of Dutchies visiting us, but then that didnt seem to amuse her. :P,MMMMM the carmelizer, iced, in June, MMMMM.

Nicest customer service!!,A drive through coffee stop is as good as you can get! Stopped (er drove through) on my way to work several times. Dutch Bros. never fails to please!! Love their rich, bold coffee and regulars, you get a stamp card, purchase 10 and # 11 is free!

Love lattes and expressos? This place is for you! They have their famous ER 911 which is a 6 shot expresso! I actually tried that one when I was on my 4th 12 hr shift (yes I`m a nurse(, and needed something kick ass to get me through my last remaining 12 hours, well the ER 911 was my hero! Love Dutch Bros!!,Amazing staff amazing coffee and always faster than Starbucks without the burnt flavor. Their cocomo drink is unreal. You must try it.,I really misjudged dutch brothers at first. The first time I went I got a drink that was way too sweet and I thought they were just another generic coffee shop. Now I've been getting their dutch coffee with an extra shot and it is just the best tasting stuff I've ever had! Don't know what the secret is with the coffee beans, but so yummy. I crave this stuff and have been getting a drink every day :) LOVE YOU GUYS- very nice staff too!,PROS:  Supremely talented and friendly servers.  they have a good knack for speaking with you as if you're a regular (and wanted) customer.  Very good text message specials, classic drive-thru, good value overall, 10-stamp freebie cards, and cleverly designed and consistent-quality drinks.

CONS:  The espresso roast itself is average.  The neat and admirable thing is that they make such good drinks around the sub-prime coffee roast, so overall they are still very good drinks.  This particular location is on the north end of the infamous ""Palomino Square"", so the location is a bit iffy, but I'm so pleased they decided to set up shop there!

Unknown:  Their frozen and ""fufu"" drinks look awfully tasty, but I wouldn't know how they rate compared to competitors.,I don't totally get the hype about this place, but it's definitely a pretty cool spot when you're riding your bike and want to stop for some coffee and car watching. My husband and I stopped here the other day, I got a delicious flavored tea and he got a yummy flavored coffee. They have a stamp program, and that's nice. The people are always super friendly. I once got a number passed to me by the barista from a guy at the opposing window. I don't think he saw my kids standing next to me because they're shorter than the window.. but I was flattered nonetheless. :),I like my coffee to be coffee-flavored. Don't throw vanilla, macadamia nut or oregano into it... I won't like it. And DEFINITELY don't top it with whipped cream. Give me 100% Colombian roast , black, and I'm happy. Therefore I don't usually buy coffee at fancy places; I brew my own. 
That being said, I went to Dutch Bros. today because I did a search for smoothies, and to my surprise they sell them at this little coffee shop by my work.
For under 5 bucks I got an acai superfruit smoothie which is thick and flavorful. It took virtually no time to prepare... I was through the drive-through in under 3 minutes. From the other posts, I was half-scared that the guy was going to talk my ear off and not make my order, but he was courteous, quick and non-patronizing. Smoothie flavors included mango, peach, strawberry and some berry blend. The cost was $4.75; tax included (which is always nice in a drive-thru).
There were a few sips where the ice was a little chunky, as in couldn't pass through the straw, but otherwise, it's an excellent texture and flavor. It is just tart enough to make you keep slurping until you get brain freeze. But it's worth the pain.,I moved to phoenix from northern California where I would get my Dutch Bros. fix almost every day! Either I was spoiled by the great customer service in my area or the service here is really that horrible. I've gone a handful of times and they have all been extremely shallow and inattentive. Not to mention they've all charged me different prices for the same drink! One person charges me $3.50 and someone else charges me $5.25?? Get your act together and be a bit more friendly and real with your customers.,This place reminds me of all the independent coffee stands you see in Washington. I love their dutch brother freeze with caramel it's alot like a granita- a slushie kind of coffee drink. MMMMM.
The service is always friendly and fast. I especially like that they have a punch card.,I drove by. Twice.

""Is that little blue drive-thru selling coffee?""

So I pull up, VERY afraid, thinking ""Mariscos De Isla De Capitan Drive-thru that sells coffee""  

""I need something with a lot of caffeeine and not a lot of sugar"" I says to the barkeep

""Oh, I gotcha covered my man""

2 seconds later I'm quaffing my quad-shot (4) espresso and milk concoction and freaking out with caffeine induced halucinations.  I was amping for 4 hours solid. God DAMN!  AMEN BROTHAS!

Simply put, I was blown away by  kick ass java, excellent service and reasonable prices.,This should just be for all the  D-Bros in existence. The name says it all. This place is really into Bros. 

BroLyfe 4 Lyfe is their motto I'm sure.

I could just imagine the training sessions these things have to go through. I'm sure it involves competitions. yeah, lots of them. You probably have to be able to recite all of Sum-41's lyrics from their first album backwards while intermittently slamming espresso shots and complimenting eachother on  forearm tattoos whilst winking at the girls and stamping frequent coffeeFREAK cards. If you still cry while listening to Dashboard Confessional even though you gained 20lbs. of muscle you will still fit in here too.

However, they are ALWAYS friendly..to the point of too much, I don't think I'm comfortable with the fact that I just told that one bro where I live, what size swimming pool I have, how far I drive to go to work, I have never been to Seattle, and thanks for offering to throw away all the trash in my car I think I'll just keep it and get to it later thanks.

They have pretty decent coffee, and lots of stickers though.

Oh one more thing..this is one of those places where the drink you really want has a ridiculous title, so you leave unsatisfied, refusing to order something called ""the annihilator"".....Boof.,This place is amazing.  The service is always top notch, it's the kind where they get to know you fast and have your coffee (or ice coffee) ready by the time you pull up to the window.  Great for all sorts of coffee with extra shots.,Best coffee and customer service in the valley! I love how friendly the staff is and they get the coffee out super fast. When there is even a slight line of cars someone will actually come running out to take orders. Not only that but they have the frequent customer punch card! Fun people. Great coffee.,The coffee is absolutely the best in town.  For the price, get the large.  They have a wide assortment of coffee combinations, specials and even yerba mate on the menu.

The staff is friendly and cheerful.

I am hooked!,This is what customer service is all about.  These people ALWAYS remember who you are and ALWAYS have a smile on their face.

They have a punch card, so every 10 drink you get a free one!  Tuesdays are double stamp days.  I mean who does that anymore?  Not to mention they have more shots in their drinks than their competitor.  They also use premium products.  I have converted many friends by one trip through the drive thru.  If you haven't been, try it out!!,Many people claim coffee inspires them, but, as everybody knows, coffee only makes boring people even more boring. 
- Honore de Balzac ""Treatise on Modern Stimulants""

Good thing I'm not goddamned boring isn't it? Are you? I didn't think so. So let's get some coffee. 

Dutch Brothers only has a drive through; and as it happens, I do not drive, but my special lady friend does, so this makes a great little ""we are late, but if I don't get coffee now so",0.292144
Drip Coffee Lounge,"Great location, interior and staff.  Love the minimal modern style in there.  Staff was very attentive and interesting.  They sell things there like organic tea and chocolate remedies too.  The drink I had there was a little too strong for my taste, so I will have to ask for one less shot next time.  But the quality of the espresso is very good.  Next time I go I will have to try breakfast.,Dangit, Drip. I've been hoping to love you for almost two years now. Having a coffee shop within walking distance of my place is a must, and so after moving to Phoenix I was thrilled to have this cute little spot just up the road. 

I find that whenever I'm in the mood (or desperate) for a nice cup of coffee they're closed. Closed on Mondays. Closed after 3. Randomly closed today (Tuesday). On the occasions when I've ventured in and found them open, my experience has been ok. There's something about the ambiance that--and another reviewer mentioned it--feels awkward. Sometimes the music is too loud and I can't work, or the place is empty and I feel guilty about sitting for a couple hours and ordering just a coffee and some toast. 

There's nothing WRONG with Drip, per se, but with so many other coffee options in town (that are reliably open), I'll be headed elsewhere for my caffeine fix.,It's been at least three months since my last vist but that's because I'm not a morning perosn and by the time I rise the doors are closed. With that being said...

I took my sister who was visiting form Seattle here and it was amazing. We had iced coffee's and I believe they said homemade jam and some bread. The jam was d-lish and the coffee was great. 

I used to be a big coffee drinker but now-a-days i barely ever drink the stuff, it hurts my stomach whenever I do. Not the case at Drip. The coffee was perfect and not a single stomach ache.

When I was there they offered free wi-fi, a thumbs up move in my opinion, had adequate seating and the atmosphere was quiet and comfortable not like Starbucks. The women helping us was a delight to talk to as well.

One day, soon, I'll have to wake up and visit again. Any of you coffee lovers that live or work in the area should definitely go check it out.,Drip's hip interior, environmental stewardship, fair prices, and good coffee and tea make it my favorite breakfast lounge in the Phoenix downtown-ish area.  The servers make you feel glad to be there, too.  You should check it out.,Looked like a cute place and it's right down the street and locally owned, so I was excited to try it out.

I think the staff (it looks like they might all be related) have been huffing toxic fumes in the kitchen.  The braincells were severely lacking throughout the place.  

I went there for breakfast, but I don't eat eggs and I don't drink coffee...this has never been a problem at any restaurant in the world...except for Drip.  They couldn't comprehend that I don't eat eggs...so basically I was ordering a breakfast sandwhich they had on the menu minus the egg (bread & ham).  This caused a 4-minute confused slo-mo conversation at the table and then the chef ( mom?) came out 5 minutes later and we had to do the the entire conversation again.  All of which was entirely unnecessary, but heaven forbid they make a lunch item for breakfast...even though the components are exactly the same and lunch started in 20 minutes.

The tea tasted average, but came in this time-consuming, over-the-top delivery system that was completely unnecessary.  It took forever for the simple-minded server to put it all together.  The server also liked hanging out at our table looking at us during our entire meal and taking things we weren't done with yet...like my half of my drink.

This was one of the most annoying dining experiences I've ever had.  Pretentious, snotty, AND simple-minded...weird!  At least when I got my food (which was still totally wrong, but it didn't have egg in it and I didn't want to talk to anyone there anymore so I ate it) it tasted good for what it was (wrong).  Everything seemed to be organic.  

If you have two brain cells and like good food, this may be the place for you...just don't confuse them...their heads might explode.,I heard about this place for years before I actually went in yesterday. It was disappointing. It ended up being a dark, humid, little sweatbox (note: bad smells!) of a coffee shop, with very little seating and terrible hours for a CenPho location (open til 3 on a Sunday...are you serious?). I ordered an Americano, which was actually quite tasty, but switched with my girlfriend because the Chai tea latte she ordered was subpar. Instead of a syrup or a powder, Drip just brews a bag of Chai and then adds milk. What you get is nothing like a Chai tea latte, but rather a milky tea that left me with gas for 16 hours. Skip this hangout.,Eggsalent Breakfast! (yah, I know sounds dorky, but it really was excellent).  Coffee is presented to you like you are the only person in world having a cup of coffee, something nice about that.  

NOTE:::  Since the last time I was in there, about a month or so ago-- it is now closed down and either has or is going to re-open as ""Toast"" but located next door?  I was confused when this was explained to me.  If you know, can you message me and let me know what is going on?  I suppose I could stop by and see for myself.,Drip has given me a reason to get up early on saturdays and sundays, no matter what time I get to bed. I used to sleep in, but no longer.

The coffee is fantastic. Organic or Fair Trade? I think so. But who cares, it's so delicious.

The food is consistently amazing. Also organic. But best of all, it's just the right amount and not pricey.

The music selection is always different and pleasant.

The ambiance is wonderful.

The owners and staff are great people and are always up for talking.

Also, unlike other coffee shops, where people sequester themselves, twittering away or burying their noses deep in text books and beat novels...

Drip encourages community between its patrons. BUT if you want/need to escape, appear mysterious, or ""read"" your book....you can always go into their spare room, which is more dimly lit and aptly designed for your hermitage needs.

Highly recommended.,I lived down the street from this joint when it opened. Great place! Small and quaint. Coffee was pretty good from what I remembered. One time I went there with my husband and he got Nutella crepes. Sounds weird but looked good!,Enjoyed the lattes and coffee. Stopped by this morning to find it's closed.,After our team yoga class we had our staff meeting at Drip this week. Gina is totally awesome, and they were super accomodating. Matt at Sutra Midtown Yoga (next door to Drip) let them know we'd be over afterwards and they had tables and chairs pulled together in the semi private space in the north part of their place.

Gina is dynamic and attentive, and the food was was especially enjoyable. Matt had talked up the NY egg sandwich and it didn't disappoint- I had mine with an over hard egg, Boar's Head bacon and tomato. The home fries were some of the best I've had. If you're in the neighborhood and looking to support a cool local place (and you should be), stop in and check out Drip!,I've been going to drip for years. Love the owners and love the new Italian cafe (BYOB, sweet) they are opening next door.

But today was a first for me. I had a soy latte. Why? Well, I think I've become lactose intolerant and wanted to try something new. It was GOOD. 

Also had the NY egg sandwich, without cheese, which was delectable. Just the right amount of chewy softness to the bagel. I do wish Sam the chocolate guy had been giving away free chocolates again, but I can't always get lucky.,I've been going to drip now for almost a year now, I love it everything about it.  Gina is always super friendly, and the food is always great.  Free Wi-fi makes it the perfect place for me to wake up in the morning, have a nice breakfast and study in an actually well lit and open coffee shop.  THe only reason I can't give it five stars is I do wish that it would be open past 3 pm, but after 3 I have to head on over to Lux.,Note to self: ALWAYS listen to Amanda B.

I spent a few hours at Drip recently, needing to get away from the Hubby, who is on a real vacation, not a working ""vacation"" as this teacher always is. Damned evaluations...

Anyway, Drip was pretty full when I arrived at 11:00, and remained fairly so until I left 3 hours later. The iced latte I had might just leave me with a bleeding ulcer, but on the other hand, the cucumber, havarti, spinach, and cream cheese sandwich I had was freaking awesome. 

The atmosphere was pretty industrial, with an awkward second room which also contained the single unisex bathroom with a separate sink just outside the enclosed stall. Really, Drip. This feels like one small step above a porta-potty. The chairs were not entirely uncomfortable, but just enough so that it kept me working. No squishy nappy-time seats here, except for one boxy couch. I suppose that's good. But sorry, Drip. Pair the whole experience with your lame hours and poor acoustics, and I can't see myself returning.,drip is a very apt name for this place. its got the heart but the actual follow through and execution leave a lot to be desired.
my first cappuchino was horribly burnt and undrinkable. i sent it back and the owner made me another. it was equally as bad but i didnt want to make a scene out of it and drank my girlfriends iced tea, after we had to ask for the ice part.
the breakfast was decent but nothing to get me out of bed to come and have.
i am giving it two stars because they were playing the portishead live album and that gets my heart strings everytime.

i know it seems harsh to judge a place on one experience but if i am going to spend money at an establishment they better make it the best experience everytime i am there. i gave drip a chance by sending my first coffee back and it came back to me just as ruined. this is not a case of accident, this is a case of not knowing how to make espresso. this is actually very common at most restaurants unfortunately no one seems to either complain about it or know when their espresso has been burned. (ie - its not supposed to taste bitter and make your face scrunch up in pain).

for a coffee shop this is just unexcusable and grants no second chances. i hope that the owner is reading this cause i do want to see them succeed and i hope that she sees this as constructive criticism.

in the meantime i have been introduced to LUX who have made me 3 caps on 3 seperate trips and each one has been perfect.,I love Drip. My partner and I stop by at least once every couple of weeks. The owner, Gina, and staff are incredibly friendly and welcoming. Every time I've been in they've all remembered our names and gone out of their way to see how we are doing.

They are all about their organic, minimalist, authentic life at Drip. Coffee is only in drip form (i.e. espresso). Food is all local and organic. And the design is modern, simple, and attractive. 

They are dog friendly and even when they are packed they make the outdoor/indoor seating work. 

If you haven't been you should. It's definitely a place that you can go with friends, have a good lunch. Or you can take your laptop, zone out, and watch the scenery. It's just not trying to be anything that it's not (unlike sooo many coffee houses I come across). That's the best part about it. Drip is drip. And Drip is good.,LOVE IT!  Drip is a FAB place!

The service was generous & friendly.  Coffee & treats? Delish! 

Free wi-fi and many easily available electrical plugs make it a hot  meeting place.

I met one of my clients there for the first time  2 weeks ago - we enjoyed it so much - we are going back again this week.

The owner Gina Madrid is as hip & gracious as they get.  Gina introduced herself & made us feel right home.   

Mod decor.  Mad good cookies.  My cup of Joe!  

Definitely worth the trip to Drip!,Love Drip. I've been coming here for a few years now, and Gina and Vene always make my daughter and I feel right at home. And where else can you be guaranteed to see the mayor of phoenix sipping a cuppa joe.
 I love the food, especially the NY egg sandwich, and the homemade goodies that are usually on display. And the coffee is excellent, always nice and strong. However, they do make everything to order, so allow some time during busy hours (lunch, etc).
 They have free wi fi, and well placed outlets, most of them are quad boxes, so you will have place to plug in.
 And I have yet to hear a bad song, so overall, I would recommend it to anyone.,I finally made it to Drip this past Thursday... 
I chose to go there because they were participating in Dining Out For Life and they were centrally located downtown.  And since I'd never been, I figured it would be a great place to host April Office Hours.

I called ahead to give a heads up that our group would be in, and they seemed concerned that the space would not be big enough.  It was fine though!  We took over the main room.  Gina took good care of our group.

I saw some of the food that they served and it looked pretty good...  some interesting sandwiches for a coffee shop including one with egg, asparagus, and prosciutto.  I however, went with an iced tea and a sparkling water.  

Note to self - honey doesn't mix well in iced tea.  Mix honey into the hot tea next time before pouring over ice!  

Since I don't live in the area, I probably won't be making a special trip to Drip anytime again soon, but if I did, I could see stopping by more often.,Wow.  After reading Dave's review below, I feel like I am not alone.

I wanted to give drip a decent chance.  After all, it's a locally-owned coffeeshop in my neighborhood.  

First of all, I walked in and didn't quite know what to do.  After seeing I  looked lost, the barista said I could have a seat anywhere.

Next, after about 5 minutes, the barista comes over and asks what I'd like.  I wanted to know if they were serving breakfast and lunch, since it was 11.00.  She said ""let's just get your drink order first"".  15 minutes later, I ordered a sandwich.  55 minutes after I walked in, I was eating my sandwich.

What?  

I stopped over because I had about an hour to kill.  You think that'd be enough time to get a sandwich and chill out.  Not that day.  The barista informed me they were short-handed.  

The sandwich I ordered, had I made it at home, would have taken about 10 minutes. 

To top it off, she asked if I liked it.  When I replied ""yeah"", she said ""You're lucky.  We just ran out of red peppers.""

Lucky me.

Yikes.  Sorry drip.  I won't be back.,Drip is a cool little space of minimalistic decor. The coffee is excellent and the owner, Gina, was very friendly to me and we had quite a nice conversation. My Americano was great!  Wi-fi internet is available so bring your laptop with you. The menu is full of organic items. This time around I didn't sample any of the food because I had just eaten elsewhere, but I'll be sure to stop back by to try them out. The cream cheese and Nutella panini sounds intriguing.,i was a bit turned off by the ambience the first time i came here - same as at lux, it kind of feels like you are stepping into an ikea catalogue.  unlike lux, though, the atmosphere gets friendlier the longer you hang around.

where lux always feels more like an office, drip definitely feels like a neighborhood joint - albeit with contemporary furniture choices.  there's a really sweet dog that runs around the place occasionally, and the owner/operator is super friendly and chatty if you want to be.

it's one of those coffee shops where you can sit and work, but there's also usually an opportunity or two every hour to jump into a convo that starts between the barista and the patrons and spreads around the cafe like a friendly communal blanket.  not that people are talking loudly - it's just a small space, so you'll be able to hear what everyone is saying unless they are speaking quietly.

the espresso is yummy.  note to the guy who got gas from an actual chai tea - that's how a chai latte is supposed to be made, man.  it's like complaining because someone gave you fresh juice instead of juicy juice.

also, the bathroom area is awesome!  i don't know why.  i just really like it.

fair warning: the chairs are not very comfy.  even the ones in the middle of the room.  which look like they are begging to hold your fanny in a warming canvassed embrace - they leave you cold and a little stiff.,No longer in business.,Went here about two weeks ago with my favorite boy for some coffee and a little breakfast.  Very surprised at the scarce furnishings inside, but everything was clean and the girl working was very helpful and friendly.  Certainly no bargains to be had here (2 coffees and a sandwich was close to $18!), but the coffee was good and the NYC Egg Sandwich that we shared was delicious!!  We both agreed we would return to try some of the other tasty things on the menu, and we both felt good supporting a local business.,It's one of those funky Phoenix institutions. They publish their menu in Java magazine and post it on the wall, so right away you know they don't do business as usual. In fact, they seem content to just cruise.

There are only a handful of tables (all two tops) but they don't mind if you pull them all together for a group. Just be prepared. The kitchen is not known for being speedy, but that's part of Drip's appeal. Sit back, relax, enjoy your coffee and conversation while you wait for you food to come out. It's worth the wait. 

I've only been for breakfast and I really like the veggie fritatta (usually has asparagus, mushrooms and red/green bell peppers) with a few dollops of sour cream baked in. It comes with a piece of the BEST toast in the world with homemade berry jam. I have to remember to ask next time where they get that bread. The toast and jam also is a great breakfast treat.. 

They brew up fresh tea for you when you order ice tea. It's served with the hot cup of tea still steeping and a cup full of ice at the ready. They also offer Italian sodas in a bunch of different flavors and, of course, coffee. 

They have free wifi and lots of plug-ins, so it's not unusual to see several laptops with people attached when you go there. The waitstaff (aka Gina) is very friendly and helpful.,Very Mod looking place ... but I found the food to be pretty bland and my carmel latte just okay ... DOG FRIENDLY patio a major plus for me and my dog.

Body:  i don't know you from adam...but i have to tell you how i feel about random folk posting negativity about drip coffee lounge. or any place for that matter.
i find it totally lame.
if you thought my organic food was bland, i'd much rather you tell me, talk to me about it so i could attempt to make it non bland for you....i wonder what you ordered?
no you have to spew negativity into the world.
curious if i was the barista that made your carmel latte???
regardless if you care enough to come back to drip i'll attempt to make you a beverage that suits your tastes.
if it was easy i guess everyone and their brother would have a cafe.

Well ... there you go ... building a community one person at a time!  I say the Lux ""Community"" is just fine ... and the coffee ... service much better ... I was originally being kind ... honestly this is the most pretentious place I've ever walked into ... and there is NOTHING cool about it ... zero substance ... only pretension ... fashion and style ... but so sorry you can't buy cool ... and this place proves it on a daily basis.,This place is super-stylish. Cheerful, modern space. Perfect for talking or working (there's wi-fi).  Really good coffee (but I'm not a fanatic). Food is well-crafted from excellent ingredients -- they're small plates, so don't expect to get stuffed. Great addition to Central Phoenix.!,Day 1: Excellent, personable service! The waiter, upon discovering it was my first time in, actually sat down at my table and told me about the establishment and their wonderful array of drinks and eats. Americano was made with fab espresso! Yum!

Day 2: Yes, I actually came back the VERY NEXT DAY! Had another Americano, and after an hour or so of studying, tried the egg creme (Note:does not actually contain egg).  This smooth, chocolaty goodness left me wanting more, so......

Day 3: Well, you get the idea. I have been here everyday to study since my first day over a week ago and still look forward to my few hours of studying, accompanied by ""rewards."" Cozy atmosphere, great staff and peaceful place to study!,I wandered in here for the first time last week.  I liked it so much I went twice more in the same week!

I met Gina Madrid, the owner, and we bonded over growing up in West Phoenix.  She was so nice and easygoing, it felt more like chatting with an old friend rather than buying an americano and cupcake.  I almost forgot to pay, and she almost forgot to charge me!

Speaking of the cupcakes:  they are deeeelicous and vegan.  I had the PB & J cupcake and it was like heaven.  Moist, creamy, and sweet all at the same time.  She said that the guy who bakes them just walked in one day and offered to let her try some of his wares.  He used to bake them at his house, but Gina liked them so much she offered to let him use her kitchen at the Lounge.  They are really really good. 

I like the minimalist decor and the fact that Gina doesn't want to display art.  Normally I would hate this, but Gina makes a great argument for having a nice blank space to clear your thoughts. Plus it can be a hassle to manage the selling of art and finding artisits that you want to sell for. 

The music is awesome!  Classic rock, rockabilly, 70's and 80's easy listening.  Ya gotta love some ""Leather and Lace"" with your vegetable fritatta in the morning!,A friend introduced me to Drip while I was visiting for a weekend. It's hard to rate the menu since we grabbed breakfast. I'm into the healthy theme and the owners seemed cool.",0.220537
Dragonfly Tea Company,"I was seriously blown away at the sheer quantity of teas in this adorable local tea shop.  I could have spent hours there, smelling and tasting teas that I have never seen anywhere else.  

The owner was incredibly helpful and assisted me in choosing a bundle of teas to give as Christmas gifts.  She even wrapped them up in cute little bags for me, and sent me off with a big cup of tea to-go. She spent a lot of time telling me about her products, and her knowledge was phenomenal - I guess that is why she owns a tea shop ;)

This is definitely my cup of tea!,Dragonfly Tea Company provided tea for the latest Local First Arizona event. Their tea was fabulous and the owner, Holly, is such a great person. She is very knowledgeable about tea and I am excited to visit her shop very soon. I highly recommend this business.,Very inviting and friendly atmosphere, no pressure while your looking either. They have a great selection of teas and a few samples to try. The lady was so helpful and patient, my mom and I were probably in there for over half an hour. They have beauty products and very unique tea cups. I will definitely be back here.

Oh and another bonus is they have great hours!,I am so happy that Groupon featured this place! The woman working on the beautiful Saturday morning that we went was extremely attentive and helpful. I needed a Mother's Day gift and she was immediately able to identify the perfect gift.  We were the only ones in there and probably stayed for 45 minutes or so. I really hope more people stop by, as it is a little hidden away because of trees out front. But it is right by the Phoenix City Grill, which is very popular. I have only been to one other tea shop, and this one offered much more in novelty items.  I will definitely be going again, when I run out of all the tea I bought!,Love this store!! Great place to shop for personalized gifts. 
They have tons of delicious smelling teas, which you can smell , taste and ogle over. My friend Kris and I stop by with my mom and we were impressed. They have ice teas, fruit teas, chocolate teas, white teas anything you can dream of. 

I am already imagining creating gift baskets with the goodies they have here. By the way , the prices are more than reasonable and give you lots of choices to contemplate. 

Stop in here to relax , shop or just get creative with tea! Love it!,With over one hundred different teas, you are likely to find whatever you are looking for here. Lately I am really into genmaichas and they have four different varieties to choose between. I am also a big fan of rooibos (also known as African red bush). I picked up their Tulsi Orange Ginger rooibos and it's great! I noticed quite a few fruity tropical green teas which I want to try iced. I will definitely be back.,Holly and staff are great. My wife got me in to tea a few months ago and I am totally novice so I ask a ton of rookie questions. However I never feel judge or as if I'm being a pain. I almost feel like a pro now. Thanks guys!,Oh my gooooooooodness!  I love this store.  I have been a tea enthusiast ever since I received a cast iron tea pot for Christmas.  A few weeks ago, I purchased a Groupon for $20 worth of merchandise for $10 and headed over to the store.  The experience was amazing.  The varieties were intriguing, the prices were reasonable, and the owner was very knowledgeable and friendly.  Also, the layout of the store was appealing and inviting.  

When we visited the store, we received a packet of tea for the stores 1st birthday.  I hope there will be many more to come.,I ended up here on a Sunday because Teavana didn't open until 12pm. This place is way better than Teavana and reasonably priced. Holly was very helpful and gave great recommendations. I love that you can smell the small jars of tea yourself and don't have to wait for someone to do it for you. There are tons of tea accessories and gifts. Holly even gift wraps!!  I also like that she sends tea to the troops overseas and you can purchase a bag of tea and personalize your own message. I recommend going here if you are interested in drinking good quality tea and have any questions. I don't live close, but will make the trip to go here.I will definitely be back!!,This place is AMAZING! I just had their Pina Colada tea that was infused with real pineapple! What a light treat for the summer. Thanks for being a great tea spot!,Disclaimer: 
I'm not a tea expert. I don't own a diffuser. I prefer my tea iced and plain because, frankly, I'm sweet enough. 

In search of the ever elusive 'thoughtful' Christmas gift for my picky sister I stopped in at Fleur de Teas in the hopes of finding something special. I wasn't disappointed. 

The shop, located next to the Phoenix City Grille, is small and cozy. Don't let the size fool you, this small spot is bursting at the seams with a huge variety of tea, tea accessories and beauty products. 

The staff was friendly and very helpful, walking me through several different varieties of tea until I found exactly what I was looking for. Needless to say, the gift was a hit (and very reasonably priced). 

I'm not a tea expert, but Fleur de Teas makes me want to be. I'll be back!,If you are looking for great quality tea, you are at the right place! An entire wall full of different tea's!!!! Service is fantastic and Holly can always help you find exactly what you are looking for! A must see and shop place in Phx!!!!,This is where I go to get my tea. I don't care if I have to drive out of my way, I'm not going to settle for less. They have the best selection of loose leaf tea. The staff is friendly and helpful and have great tea recommendations. Thanks to Fleur de Teas, I am branching out into iced teas. Never before have I tasted an ice tea blend that was worth drinking. 
Fleur de Teas, I love you.,Holly was awesome and I was looking for a black cinnamon herbal mix. She picked out a couple with me and actually suggested something out of left field a early grey tea which I'm not a fan of.. but one sniff and I had to try it. I bought more then I thought I would ...love the prices of the tea. I'll be back for sure since I just finished my tea about a week ago its about time lol.,Based on the reviews on Yelp, I was quite excited to see this new tea shop in PHX.  My visit was less than thrilling, however.  I must pretense my review with the fact that I'm a purist, a little bit of a snob and opinionated.  I can appreciate tea blends - I make certain ones myself.  They serve a place and a purpose.  That said, I expect to be able to buy pure loose tea leaves at a place specializing in tea.  In fact, you'd think that's the main focus of a tea shop, but here it seems blends and spices are what keeps things together.

They have lots of ""teas"" and accessories.  Maybe blends and masking tastes is what the public wants - I have no idea.  I do know that I'd think even a medium shelf, quality estate leaf would be available (or rather, the focus) at a tea shop.  I know you've seen shops like Adagio - you have their products.  When I heard this place opened, I thought it could be the first and only in PHX to really hit the nail on the head.  C4 still remains the place to go in a pinch; at least there I can get something called ""darjeeling"" (even if that's almost as vague as calling it ""Chinese black tea"").,Love this store!  A great place to buy local for one thing, and be ecstatic with all the choices of tea and gifts for anyone!   I have bought tea for myself, but went in for some to send to a soldier in Afghanistan, and as soon as the owner knew what I was doing, she asked for his address and said she would adopt him and his company and send out a box of tea and goodies!  What a wonderful surprise!!  I can't recommend any one tea in particular because the six I have so far tried have been awesome!,Great tea store!  The owner is always on site and is the most knowledgeable tea person that I have ever met.  They have samples of all of their teas to smell before purchasing, such a great idea.   They also have a nice store with plenty of neat items to purchase.,This is a wonderful shop to purchase tea and tea accessories.  My partner got me a teapot from them at a considerably modest price compared to nearby tea shops.  The owners are friendly and knowledgeable.  If you enjoy delicious loose tea, you will love Fleur de Teas!,I had some time alone yesterday so I ventured out to use my Groupon.  I was aware of this place, but never stopped in.  I must say that the quality and overall taste of the tea in this store is by far the finest in the Valley.

I am a tea lover so this store was quite a find for me.  In addition, they sell a number of tea related gadgetry and trinkets.

The tea selection is mainly sold in 100g packs between $5.00 and $7.00.

My only suggestion would be to increase seating and sell some mancha and other less common pure teas.

A helpful and well learned staff.

Give it a try.,Friendly, helpful, above and beyond service. Delightful gifts. Gift wrap is free! I will be purchasing many more gifts from Fleur de Teas.,I think this place is now called ""dragonfly teas."" But whatever the name, this place is exceptional. Everyone is so nice (even to children) and the tea selection is great. The tea is as good (if not better) than Teavana, but half to a quarter of the price. Be sure to try Lemon Love Affair...  Its Orgasmic!,I ended up back at Fleur de Teas today because my mom had purchased a groupon after some friends bought her a tea pot and she remembered that we had bought a groupon here before. So when the second groupon offer rolled around she bought it right away.

What a nice surprise it was to walk in and find out that they also now sell spice blends! It was magic to my nose! I spent nearly fifteen minutes sniffing every spice blend while my mom chose her tea. The toasted coconut sugar was delicious, there was a balsamic blend that I wanted to lick right out of the bag, and they even had pure vanilla. Amazing! If I could have I would have bought every bag. The prices were pretty reasonable too. I didn't see any bag priced over $7 and most of them were in the $4-5 range. 

So now not only should you come for the tea, come for the spice blends! They are all fantastic!",0.325503
Copper Star Coffee,"Alright, I'm officially off Starbuck's...when I'm in Phoenix at least. I ordered the coffee of course because how else are you going to determine the quality of a coffee house without testing the main ingredient. So one iced coffee with irish cream and low fat milk...Boom! my new favorite coffee house. The decor is quaint and artsy. Stone floors and brick walls mean a nice cool escape from the insane heat we all live in and the guys behind the counter actually seemed like they were happy to be at work. I even like the building itself, which appears to be converted from a 50's gas station with a single serving pump which now serves as the drive-through. Tomorrow morning I'm gonna head down early and enjoy a newspaper in my new favorite coffee house.,Great Coffee
Great Atmosphere
Good Baked Goods
Friendly Staff
Fun and Hip,Needed to get out of the West Valley last Saturday and decided to put on the pretense of being productive at Copper Star. It was very quiet and laid back. I sat on the purple couch for 4 hours and savored every drop of my latte. AND double bonus for being within walking distance of the Fry Bread House. Perfect lazy Sat afternoon!,I love that this is an old gas station.  Hooray for recycling buildings into something new rather than tearing them down.  I've been a fan of this place since it opened.  Today I tried the applesauce spiced vegan cupcake, and it was pretty amazing.  You should try it too!,This is the place that I go to de-stress, to do homework, to celebrate a happy occasion.  I will take any excuse to go here.  I love that when I walk in I am always greeted with a smile and that there is never attitude.  The baked goods are irresistible but the coffee is what keeps me coming back.  There isn't a better soy latte in the entire valley.  It is deep but mellow and never, ever bitter.  I love CSC!!,Much respect to Copper Star Coffee.

I am almost always in my p.j.s when I am driving my sweet ,second-grade scholars to school, and I am always jonesing for some good powerful cafe.  But I can't really get out of the car.  I like the cofee brought out to me presto! by some of the most laid-back, friendly people.  Drive through coffee is so American.   

Any a sort of bagel/breakfast sandwich situation will cost you, about 15 minutes of your life.  Good and hearty.

The car hops are so wonderful.  They make procuring coffee (the most daunting task in my pre-coffee morning ritual) sort of pleasant.

I don't know anything about the Wi-Fi or the pastries, though.,I love copperstar! Great staff and pleasant atmosphere. Wish they would have the roll-up door open more often and had a better selection of pastries in the afternoon an evening but its still pretty tasty! 

My favorite drink is the Coconut Latte with a half pump of chocolate syrup. it's great hot and cold!,The Copper Star Coffee shop has several reviews already and without being too verbose and periphrastic, I will keep my review short.

Coffee ~ very good, full bodied taste without bitterness and has a good aroma.

Coffee Accompaniments ~ good selection of cookies, pastries, tarts.  I asked them to heat my brownie ; -) it was chocolicious X2!

Service ~ very friendly and happy and eager to please

Decor ~ it used to be much more comfy with more couches and big comfy chairs.  I think they are trying to accommodate more people with the use of big wooden tables and hard chairs. It used to be much more comfy with more room to move and set up better to meet with friends.  

All in all, it's a great place for a cup of joe if your in the area.  They have a convenient drive through if you don't have time to stop.,simple, beautuful space inside with delicious coffee!,Just went there today and bought an iced mint mocha. I wanted to see how it compared to Coffee Rush's iced mint mocha.  I was dissapointed.  First of all, Copper Stars 20oz iced mint mocha is $5. One dollar more than Coffee Rush's 20oz iced mint mocha. 

Second off all the iced mint mocha was very dissapointing. Hardly could taste any mint. Not worth $5 maybe $3.,This is nice, lil coffee bar, good to study, bcz their music isn't too loud and if is it, they can turn it down for u. Also they do have a great coffee, is strong and tasty, better that in starbucks. The people that comes here is a lil bit different from other coffees that I like to go, but the ambient is quite and relaxing.... I WOULD SAY YES COME HERE AND ENJOY A GOOD COFFEE, STUDY AND HAVE A CONVERSATION BCZ IT IS NICE!!!,Copper Star Coffee is super-adorable with a nice, mellow atmosphere and quiet ambience. I don't normally drink coffee so they served me up an enormous glass of iced green tea and a huge cupcake from the case. The cupcake tasted a little boxy but the iced tea was light and refreshing, and their small advertising section with flyers for local bands and other extracurricular activities just might point you in the direction of an excellent show or an interesting new hobby... it did for me. :),If you want good coffee without the corporate coffee environment,  then Copper Star Coffee is for you.  Take a seat with some friends and relax on the couch, converse over coffee and the best homemade cupcakes that will ever grace your lips.  This place is top notch, the decor is artsy,  the owner is friendly and his employees are cool.  GO!  ENJOY!  Kick your feet up!  Check out the awesome bathrooms too. FREE WI-FI.,Huge points for unique atmosphere. This is a great ""local"" place with fresh made pastries, salads and goodies plus good beverages. And despite what others wrote, I had no problems with the wi-fi. This is for all the caffeine addicts who want a cool place to hang and have a coffee, but are completely over Starbucks. I have to throw in another comment about the atmosphere-this is what gives it the edge over the chains. Definitely worth checking out.,Went in this morning while my dog got groomed next door. Great atmosphere, nice to just kick back, relax and read while you drink your coffee. I ended up with a vegan muffin, which i don't care about but it still tasted good. I would recommend it.,i hate to admit it but.. i love that this place has a drive thru!  i'm a real grab n' go kinda girl a lot of the time and i think this brings me to copper star more often than i realize. (until *surprise* my stamp card is full again?!)

the coffee is not the best in the city.. but at least it's local and that counts for something. plus i like the concept of gas station gone coffee shop.  

(and i love stars.),I hate it when I wake up early on a Saturday! I mean, the one day of the week when I don't have to set the alarm and I can sleep as long as I like, and BOOM, wide awake at 7 anyway! Theoretically, I know I should be take advantage of the cooler morning temperatures and mow my lawn, but that's what Sundays are for, right? If you ask me, Saturday mornings are much better suited for relaxing and sipping coffee. Thankfully, I live just down the street from Copper Star Coffee (and luckily for my dog, Copper Star is right next door to Wag 'n Wash). The setup of this place is perfect, super cute converted gas station, and plenty of space on the patio for my pup to play greeter. You can get pretty much any kind of coffee/espresso drink you like, but I really dig the plain 'ol brewed coffee. Oh, and don't get me started on the tasty treats ogling me from their strategic position inside the glass case. The pastries are so yummy and cupcakes are irresistible (and share-with-a-friend-enormous). 
Hmm, on second thought, waking up early on a Saturday may just be my body's way of telling me get to Copper Star before they run out of chocolate raspberry croissants.,Oregon chai. Spicy Oregon chai. That's all I care about. And Copper Star has it. They also have a nice atmosphere, cool patio with great misters, friendly staff and a big, plush couch.

Sorry, I can't help coffee drinkers with this review.  But if you like chai, they'll make it however you want it--even blended though it's not on the menu.

Now they just need to open up shop in Old Town and I'm set.

Bonus--it's right next to a very cool record store.  That sells real records!,I really like this place.  Nice friendly atmosphere.  Drive through.  Oh, and, small point, good coffee.  (Only good---not great, but I'm a coffee snob.)  When their wireless shifts from spotty to stable, I'll be there all the time. 

PS: Get there at an insanely early hour, i.e., 6:30am, and you'll have yummy muffins just out of the oven.  mmmm.......,Best Mocha's hands down! 

My wife and I have been card carrying members for awhile now. We will always pick up a cup when taking our dogs to Wag N Wash. Friendly staff and comfortable little patio. Support local biz and give Copper Star a shot.,I love their scones.  I'm not a huge coffee drinker and I'll admit that I often review coffee houses based on their baked good offerings.  I enjoy supportin glocal businesses which is what is important to me.  The location is cute and they have free wifi.  Lots of people are seen working here with their laptops open with a scone before them.  Seriously, you need to get the cranberry scone.  Crumbling and crunchy on the outside.  Tender and perfectly balanced sweetness/tartness on the inside.  I'm hungry again ....,This is my favorite coffee shop. Their coffee is great, the staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is very relaxed. I bring my dogs sometimes, and they are totally cool about them being there with me. The drive thru is pretty convenient, too when I'm in a hurry. I'd say it's hard to find a better cup of coffee for a better price in the area.,The grand coffee shop litmus test is this:  how well can the joint brew a basic cup of joe? 
I went to Copper Star seeking reprieve from the mean little cups of hotel coffee I'd been forced to ingest during weeks of travel and found my new safe haven!  
The basic brew is fresh, good, solid coffee.  I also found they also rock americanos and cappuccinos.   

The baked goods look unpolished, but taste good.  I think the cupcakes are in desperate need of more icing and the sandwich I tried was sort of * meh *.  

Place is situated in a renovated old-time gas station and has a down to earth kind of luxury feel w/ plush sofas, and stolid wooden tables for lots of workspace.  Provocative, hippyish local art.   FREE blues band rocks out there every Sunday.  Baristas are sweethearts and they don't dawdle.    I bless you.,A Mind is a Terrible Thing to Close.

As part of my series of sampling Phoenix indie coffee shops, I finally got to this place. I parked behind the gas station designed coffee shop; at one of the few spots around the perimeter of the shop. I came inside and checked out the decor, and it continues the classy gas station tempo. I like it's visually uniqueness.

I ordered my regular ice coffee with measured instructions and it tasted typically good like from other coffee places I've visted. What I enjoyed even more was the atypical meal offering; a big curry chicken sandwich, my first experience. Their service was excellent as they brought my items to my table and they gladly answered questions about the experience and product offering of this place. 

The wifi was very reliable. I was able to get a lot of work done on my laptop during the many hours I was there and ordered more items. I think that is attributable to the very quiet atmosphere of the place, too quiet for me as I hardly hear anyone have any converstation and I didn't feel comfortable about talking on my phone here. So I'm not sure if this is a place to bring in a group to discuss work or socialize. 

I was told by a friend that this is a special coffee shop. If I rate the place based just on the coffee and memorable food, I would definitely come here again to try out other items, put aside the petty downsides .,Rating: 4.5 Stars. A real, true, legitimate coffee shop!

What I Liked: Coffee was decent (ordered an Iced Mocha). The fresh-out-of-the-oven Cheese Danish was AMAZING though...and definitely worth a trip back. The atmosphere was peaceful, the staff was friendly, and I LOVE that they bake their own goods in-house (a rarity these days).

Room For Improvement: The coffee was decent...it was good...but I was hoping for outstanding. I prefer a stronger, smokier roast. Also, the wi-fi was deplorable. It was beyond intermittent--it would be on for one minute, then off for 5. Very frustrating.

Overall: If they improved their internet, and I ordered stronger drinks from them, then Copper Star is/would be the perfect coffee shop. I'm a fan; if you live anywhere nearby, you owe it to yourself to frequent this place. ...Why can't we have a real coffee shop like this in Ahwatukee!?!,Awesome little coffee/tea joint. They have free wifi with tables and couches and is fun to chill out in. Parking is the only downside side for this place so you will have to park on the street which really is not all that bad. I have not tried the baked goods yet and will have too soon. Other reviews say the baked goods are really good.,Small coffee shop. 

I only gave it 3 stars because I went here to get free WiFi because my condo's internet went out, to discover the WiFi here was in and out. I even told the employee there that the internet was down and he tried to reset the wireless, but still the WiFi did not work. 

I got a chai latte here. It was good, but I was disappointed that it was my first time there and I wasn't offered a punch card, the ""special offer"" on Yelp. However, the customer after me got one, which kind of ticked me off. 

There isn't much parking, so you have to find parking on the streets. 

Overall, probably wouldn't come here again.,very unique place! i have only been here once so far but what i mostly like about this business beside the great service, decor, and tea is the hours are good, i luv LoLa's coffee bar too however they close at odd hours, Sundays i either chill at home, catch a movie or grabb a cup of joe. At Copper Star Coffee they stay open till 9pm Sundays which is an okay time for me. I have yet to try their coffee but the one time that I have been there i tried the ""king size"" earl grey tea which rocked! I plan to pass the word around and also will be going back real soon! kewl place go check it out!  =X,I feel like such an asshole for never having been here before this week. A friend recommended it to me saying, ""it's kind of like Lux, but gayer and nicer"". Sounds good to me!

This place is so cute! There are few tables outside and even a little fire place. Inside feels spacious even though it's not a large place. The coffee is fine, nothing phenomenal but tasty enough. Everyone was friendly. 

Two things that made me fall in love:
$2 enormous iced teas
FREE SOY MILK. Well, maybe not free...but I've never met a coffee shop that didn't charge half a dollar extra for soy. THIS IS AMAZING. I was so pleased when I ordered two medium sized iced white mochas with soy and my total was only $8 and some change. 

I wish I had come here sooner. I could have logged all those college study hours here rather then all those other lame soy charging snobby barista'd $5 for a microscopic small cup coffee shops. Ya know?

I can't wait to try the hummus plate and their veggie sandwich!,I love this place, when classes are in session, I'm here like 3-4 times a week. They have delicious pastries and drinks. Plus its by all the sweet vintage shops, a great way to kill a few hours.,I found out about this place after we lost our progressive talk radio station in Sacramento.  I started streaming Nova-M Radio from the Phoenix station on iTunes and heard an advertisement for Copper Star a number of times.  When it became clear that I would be moving to the Valley I made it a point to come by this place.  I was SO not disapointed.  They have pretty good mochas and if you hit them at the right time they will have whipped cream infused with some flavoring....nice touch.  I can't say anything about their wi-fi since I don't have a laptop but just for the atmosphere and their support of good radio I have to max out on the star count.

Addendum 3/4/09

Nova-M is dead but Copper Star lives on and rocks just as hard as they always did!!!,Cute and affordable. Finally an alternative that I actually want to go to!
Every time I try to break away from the corporate coffee chains, I get burned because their lattes taste like dirt, or they act like they've never heard of soy milk.  Come on people!  

That's what I loved about this place, the staff actually knew what they were doing, and the menu included all the necessities, plus a few of their own creations!  Try the mint mocha...uh, YUM!  They make a great soy vanilla latte too.,I loved the environment (quiet and sleek) and the coffee was good enough, but Copper Star's free wireless internet was completely maddening. I'd hoped to do some work, but an endless parade of disconnects drove me to more friendly internet confines at Lola's, which was a shame, because I wanted a sandwich.,Cool place with lots of charm, this ain't no chain coffee house.

I just had an iced coffee which was very good and the red cupcake.  

-----I'm gonna get kicked in the nads and/or have several drinks thrown on me at the next Yelp event for sure for this next comment.--- 

The cupcake was just average, and the frosting was even a bit grainy. 

I'm gonna go buy a ""cup"" now so it doesn't hurt when I get kicked in the nads by everyone who loves their cupcakes.,Super cool spot to get some java and check email. Great prices locally owned. Very cool art work that switches out every month.,I have stopped into Copper Star on previous occasions, during street festivals, but today was the first time I came to sit and study. Man, am I a fan of this place. I am lucky that I live in a location where I have a multitude of options (Lux, Lola, Hob Nobs, SBUX, etc) but I have to say I really liked the vibe here. The music wasn't loud, the people relatively quiet and chill, and I could actually focus on what I was doing without getting too distracted by everything around me. I liked that while on a busy street (7th Ave), the entrance and windows actually face the side street it is on. That added to the peace and quiet of it. Employees were nice, free wi-fi (internet key is needed but on a sign in the shop), and I enjoyed my small, mint mocha with a chocolate chip cookie (both just under $7). I was definitely eyeing the cupcakes in the bakery window but my tummy only had enough room for a cookie (which was soooo good if I might say). They are open until 9pm on Sundays which is pretty cool. I have yet to use their drive through for coffee, but they are open pretty early which is nice competition to SBUX. There is also outdoor seating which will be so nice when it starts to cool off....you can give your dog a bath at Wag-n-Wash next door and then sit outside with them while you enjoy some local coffee.,perfect place to sit and enjoy some delicious coffee in a relaxing environment with friendly staff and vegan items available, as well.,i've been to copper star since it first opened, pre-yelp days for me and my locavore ways were still being established but eversince my first copper star experience I've been in love with this coffeehouse. I just love their place, the former gas station turned coffeehouse makes this place as one of the places i bring out of town guests to show them that Phoenix does have its little gems and 7th ave or ""melrose"" is just quaint. Anywho, I've had good chai here, and yummy creamy nonfat vanilla lattes but only recently did I try a pastry treat. The lady behind the counter was a sweetheart and she made me feel extra special when she liked my ""human"" shirt and asked who designed it... yes that day i was proud to be a Gay Black Woman... as my shirt starts off with. I bought myself the nonfat vanilla latte with carrot cake cupcake that had what seemed was an extra dollop of cream cheese frosting, DeLISH! it was truly carrotrific, and the cupcake provided a great sweetness kick to go with my extra caffeinated beverage. Copper Star may not be a Lux with it's urban chic interior, or the real bohemian interior of Lola on Roosevelt or the hipster cool of Cartel in Tempe, no, Copper Star is simply cool with its venue and hold its own with its great drinks, coffees and treats, so hence Copper Star is truly a coffeehouse star!,I usually don't like to add to a review pile-on, especially when all that needs to be said has been said. But in my effort to drink more local coffee, and less of The Siren's, I have to add my oh-two.

I dig Copper Star -- good coffee, friendly crew, a drive through. Heck, one time, I even got a free Powerball ticket there.

I only have one quibble, and it's a small one. I only mention it because I care. It's the excessive and cheesy signage.

I liked the little hand-painted sandwich board, that read, ""drink local coffee."" It fit perfectly with their local business vibe.

Now that sign has been repainted in a more generic manner, and moved to the side. In its stead is a gigantic white vinyl banner, on it, printed in stark, black, all caps ""DRIVE THRU COFFEE.""

Gag. 

So now there's the generic sandwich board, the huge banner, the flappy flags, and the neon in the window. 

I understand that they are trying to increase business. But now it's looking like a used car lot, and reeks of desperation. People don't like to patronize desperate business, because it's sad, and makes them feel sad too.

Please, Copper Star, dial it down a notch. Share your message with confidence, but without shouting. We will still love you!

EDIT: OK I stopped by the very next day, and the ""DRIVE THRU COFFEE"" banner was replaced by a huge red banner with all caps white lettering that reads, ""SANDWICH KING OF 7TH AVE.""

Ulgh.,This place is super cute and the employees are pretty friendly.  The vibe is laidback and neighborhoody, making you want to hang out there forever.  They make an excellent Iced Chai Tea Latte and the giant cupcake that I had was delicious as well.

I only wish I lived within walking distance of Copper Star so that I wouldn't have to worry about parking, which can be a bit tricky at times.

Definitely check out the cool bathrooms (I'm guessing the men's is as nice as the women's) before you leave.,Love this place!!  Everyone is friendly and the coffee is so good.  They have good frozen coffee drinks and pretty decent food for a coffee shop.  Good urban environment also. They also have a punch card.,the best coffee in maricopa county.

there might be a place in SF that i like better...  but the commute's a bitch.,Nice lil spot here...
Have walked past it many many times but never went in.
I don't drink coffee,have an interwebs connection at home,and really have no reason to go...
Until a friend checked in today so I walked over to socialize.It's comfy and cozy both inside and out.
I never know what to order on the rare occasion I do find myself in a coffee place like this,but I do know it'll be expensive.
So I ask about iced teas.The lady behind the counter who was uber friendly and nice recommeneded a few different things and I went with some herbal thingamajig.
Got a BIG cup full of light goodness.I was expecting to hear something like 5 bux,but it was only 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
would I go back?I might rabbit,I might.
Except some of of the denizens were of the hipster faux hippie persuasion,and well,I didn't care all too much for the great unwashed the first time around and I would prefer my tea hippieless here in the new millenium.
If my friend checks in again,I'd follow him over.
Just wouldn't go on my own.,I'm waiting here at Copper Star as my car gets an oil change. The free wifi is a nice perk since I'm supposed to be working right now, but it doesn't make up for the bland toffee coffee ice blended ($4.25 for 16 oz) and greasy crumbly red velvet cupcake ($2.50). 

It's a cute shop though and I'm all about supporting local businesses so I'll give them another shot next time I'm in the area.,Overrated, trying too hard and wifi too slow to use. Copper Star is like if Lux and Long John Silver's (what's with the front-lit, cartoony menus on the wall?) had a baby. 

At least they serve Oregon Chai.,Copper Star is my go-to coffee joint. Their coffee is great, their iced tea is great, and their sweet treats are great.

The GIANT rice crispy treat is gooey and buttery and delicious - just like it should be.

Nice counter staff & baristas. The owner is super nice too.

Can't beat the location and the price - and the free Wi-Fi. 

Also the band that plays on Sunday mornings is AWESOME!,Great atmosphere!  It may be an acquired taste for Starbucks drinkers such as myself.  I'll admit I usually drink iced NF sugar-free vanilla lattes with whip at Starbucks.  I told the barista and he was very nice about trying to make a similar coffee concoction.  (Are they ""baristas"" everywhere? Sounds so pretentious.) I'd like to say I loved his version but it wasn't as sweet.  (I know, I'm a huge sweet tooth spoiled by corporate coffee peddlers.) My mom usually gets a Venti White Chocolate Frappuccino so the barista whipped up something similar but she also felt hers wasn't sweet enough.  I say hey, check the place out, the atmosphere's GREAT and the staff sure does try but if you like your coffee drinks sweet be forewarned, they may not taste sweet enough.,Loved this place.  Out of all the five local coffee joints I stopped by during a trip to Phoenix, this one I'd have to say was the best of them.  I drove past them while pursuing breakfast, but decided to stop by on my way back down 7th, to have a cup of coffee and figure out what to do with the rest of my day.

There isn't a ton of parking, but there is plenty of places to park on the street.  It's a small, cozy, repurposed gas station as everyone else has pointed out, and the interior is simple, yet relaxing feeling.  Parents with their kids sit outside of this kind of place.  Older people relax with a cup of coffee with their dog on a leash at this kind of place.  Younger hipsters hang out inside on their mobile devices at this kind of place.  The garage door was open, so a cool morning in Arizona could be enjoyed by everyone.  The couches inside were precariously cushy as they engulf you when you sit down.

The cookie I ordered as a dessert to breakfast was still warm when it was served to me.  The chocolate chips were gooey and soft, and it was practically right out of a commercial, with a slow camera pan on my hands as I ripped a chunk off with a rivulet of milky chocolate stretching away.  The coffee was not burnt-tasting or overly bitter, and was probably the best I had on my trip.

And everyone who worked there was polite and friendly.  Several of them took the time to address my questions about the area, and if they had any suggestions of anything to do, whether it was in the city or out in Surprise where I was headed.

The experience as a whole was easily worth five stars.  Convenient location, free parking, great atmosphere, friendly staff, and quality products.  Easily a repeat trip next time I'm out in Phoenix.,Copper Star is a great independent coffee house which you should support with your hard earned cash.  Now.  Quick, while I'm still sitting here in Copper Star using the free wireless and debating buying one of their T-Shirts.

I find the atmosphere to my liking.  It has sort of a post-industrial-masculine-unpretentious sort of thing going on.  The neighborhood seems to be waning sketchy waxing to hip trendy.

My very good iced coffee is almost gone and they just cleared my plate from the cupcake I recently finished.

I'll be back.  Gabi is having Yelp office hours here.  I might make that one.,Is it possible to have a crush on a coffeeshop?

This place is, by far, my favorite new discovery in ages.  I've been driving past it on my way to and from work for ages but never had the time to stop in.  I have friends who rave about the place and go regularly, so I really wanted to check it out.  I finally did this past Saturday (5/31) and I scolded myself for not having done so sooner.

My friend and I found a parking space out back in the tiny parking lot and walked in not really knowing what to expect.  One patron sat at a table with her laptop and the rest of the place was empty.  The friendly girl at the counter took our orders and gave her own recommendations for cool drinks.  I took her up on her suggestion of a peach smoothie.  It was wonderful - like drinking pureed peaches!  I took a sip of my friend's latte and knew I would be ordering one of my own at some point in the near future.  Before taking our drinks, my eyes lingered over the cupcakes on display; I must admit I drooled a bit.

Because it was such a nice night, we sat outside and enjoyed our drinks.  It wasn't long before more people showed up.  A group of older folks joined us outside and a few other groups and couple settled inside.  My mind kept going back to the cupcakes I saw earlier, and I ended up going inside to buy one.  My choices were vanilla, red velvet, lemon, and strawberry (I think).  Not only were the cupcakes quite sizeable, but they had sprinkles - goldfish and piggies!  Very nice touch.  I ended up selecting a vanilla funfetti cupcake with bright blue icing and goldfish sprinkles.  It wasn't anything spectacular - just a cupcake made from a box cake mix - but it was a very nice treat and that much more special due to the fishies.  I know - it doesn't take much to make me happy.

I've since been back twice and have used the very convenient drive-thru.  The first time, the man who came out to greet me asked if I had my stamp card after he took my order.  When I told him I didn't, he told me he would give me one, and he did - along with three stamps!  that morning I had another peach smoothie and decided to try the red velvet cupcake.  The smoothie was just as ood as the first, but this cupcake was VERY tasty - much better than the vanilla funfetti.  I stopped again this morning and ordered a vanilla latte.  That sucker far surpassed the vanilla lattes I usually get at Starbucks.

I love supporting local businesses, and I'm only too happy to return to Copper Star time and again.  I suggest you do, too!,Used to be an old gas station. Creatively decorated, warm, chill spot. Very good coffee & exceptional danishes & baked goods.  Very friendly staff. Nice break from weird hipsters at other coffee shops.  Has better community vibe.,Nice staff! Great sandwiches! Great coffee and drinks! Free wifi! and great hours! 6am to 9pm or 11pm (Fri. & Sat.). Nice local feel.,Went around lunch today and got a blended double chocolate mocha. The staff were really nice and the building is really cool, but my coffee was more of a milk shake than any sort of blended coffee - I even asked to make sure it was made with coffee. It had no coffee flavour at all and certainly wasn't ""double chocolate"". I loved all their different seating, the vintage cash register and even one of the coolest bathrooms I've ever been in, but if I'm going to pay nearly $5 for a 16oz drink, I want it to taste amazing. Was also disappointed that they didn't have any real selection in the bakery case - it was all sandwiches, breads, and a tarte (which looked good but was also overpriced). They apparently won some prizes for ""best cupcake"" or something and there were NO cupcakes in the case when I went in.,Can you give extra stars for cute barristas? That's probably unfair. Plus, it's unnecessary because Copper Star earns five stars on its own merit.

Phoenix has yet to turn me on. Now, I am sure there are many hidden oases of awesome out here in the desert, but I haven't found many. Thank you, Copper Star for not being a mirage. I enjoyed your coffee. I'm glad you have free wi-fi  and I really like the feel of your cafe. I'd say it's crisp. That's the term I'd give to Apple products if I didn't dislike Apple. Crisp: you've got it, Copper Star. Next time I'm in Phoenix...let that not be soon, I'm going to linger at one of your tables and savor another cup of joe and be content.,Can I just start by saying how much love I have for our local coffee shops?  You just can't beat the personal attention and genuine care these places give.  You all know I love me some Giant on my Monday mornings (close to work! great vibe! good music!  STELLAR coffee!) and I gotta get down on Jobot on my way in to my second job.  Songbird's been frickin",0.304507
Cartel Coffee Lab,"I have to say that I was pretty intimidated to try Cartel about a year and a half ago - simply based on poor service reviews and threats of hipster judgment.

When I want coffee, its because I'm beastly. I just woke up, I'm not looking like the hottest/hippest/nicest person in Tempe. I mean, I never look like that but when I NEED coffee, I need to dose myself in a safe and secure environment.

So I went to Cartel expecting the worst, I ordered Iced Toddy. To keep my order neutral and cheap. It was okay. Pretty f-ing good in comparison to xtreme bean, my only other Toddy experience. I branched out into soy Lattes because I like to get some protein in the morning. I know....latte for breakfast - aren't I a pillar of health?

NO ONE judged me when I would order my soy latte with sugar-free vanilla in it. NO ONE. I've gotten some jokes about it, but who gives a fuck? It's $4.50 - I'm being a yuppie suburban bore when I order it and I know it and I don't give a shit if they know it. I love them for keeping me in check anyways. How is a kid from Tempe supposed to know anything about coffee? That's not my business. As the customer, it's our business to try new things as suggested by the people who's life's work is coffee.

So I tried an americano by suggestion. Its DELICIOUS. GET ONE. Iced/Hot, whatthefuckeverjustgetone. I go here for an americano EVERY SINGLE DAY OF MY LIFE except when I am out of town and I bemoan the lack of Cartel even when I'm in Los Angeles (Mighty City of Intelligentsia). Which brings me to another point, the LINES.

If you are looking for a McLatte, they exist. It's called McDonalds. They are everywhere. Cartel is not a run in/run out kind of place. They are offering a luxury item as well as an experience. You wouldn't go to a spa and bitch about your facial taking too long. If you want to see lines, go to Intelligentsia during the midday rush and you will immediately appreciate what Cartel is doing.

For serving the entire ASU community with outstanding coffee, 20 minutes sounds about right. For a drink that is delicately crafted from bean to cup, $2.50-$4.50 is just right. For a locally owned company successfully competing with corporate giants, you might as well just go and give a deserving shop your money. 

And if you are nervous about being judged by the ""hip"" kids who look like they smelled a fart, recognize that they are only posing with their macbooks and modern literature and are too vain to break character. 
And if you are nervous about being judged by the baristas, try SMILING at the people who are SERVING you - because you remember how hard it was to deal with customers before you got your middle management salaried job, right?

I love you, Cartel.,This place has the best dirty chai in Tempe! Their other espresso drinks are also consistently good. The only downside is that unless I go early in the morning, the pastries get sold out before I get there. Also, there aren't many outlets so it's not good for laptop studying.,This is truly a hidden gem in the valley. It looks like a small little shop from the outside but when you enter you're greeted by the amazing smell of coffee and much much more room then you couldve ever imagined. The coffee itself is amazing and the staff is awesome. I'll never go to Starbucks again!,By far the best coffee around. Lots of coffee shops are run by snobs, but the baristas here will gladly take time to answer any questions or take custom orders.,Since I had some poor customer service experiences at Cartel, they've really made an effort to improve. There is still some snark, but I haven't seen any rudeness in a long time. They're making a definite effort to educate or work with customers.

Their coffee has always been top notch, and if they continue to develop the service side of the equation they are going to be solidly one of the best coffee shops in town.,When I noticed Cartel was listed on Living Social as ""Best place for an espresso"" I was shocked to realize I hadn't reviewed this place yet! Cartel is just a few blocks from my apartment and I must say that in a world of over-convenient, cheap coffee bars and café's Cartel Coffee Lab has done a fantastic job of separating themselves from the pack! Cartel is tucked off of University in a little strip mall but is well worth the visit if you're looking for a place to grab a brilliant brew of coffee or stupendous steep of tea!

Keep singing,

-Jerron,What's best to support a local company?   No need Starbuks or coffee bean, when you can have great non burnt coffee.   The decor is fun n hip, I love seeing the different customers there too.   Everyone is nice n down to earth.... They also have wifi and great music, while u sip your hot or iced mojo....,This might be the only truly excellent coffeeshop in the entire greater Phoenix area.  they are serious about their coffee and don't screw around, so you should want that if you are going to go.  I understand how it might not be your scene if you just walked in the door.  I went on a mission to find this place while in town briefly, had a great dry cap, left very satisfied.,Only place in all the greater Phoenix area I would come for a macchiato...I'd drive miles for it (And I did),We go to Arizona every year to visit family but this is the first time we ""reached out"" to find out where the good coffee lives. A local told us about Cartel, which was located on Memory Lane for my wife, so it was easy to find (""just past where I used to drink a giant soda before working at the vintage clothing store and or record store."") . It seemed like we were going to someone's apartment, but behind the door, shockingly enough, was a comfortable coffee shop with easily the best drip coffee I've had during six Christmas trips to The Zona. I bought a bag of beans to take back and the gentleman told me ""19$ a bag...and worth every penny."" I just made a cup in Oakland, CA and I have to agree. My one qualm: their incredibly nice and comfortable t-shirts accentuate my man boobs.,A hot spot for the local hipster community. Coffee is delicious, yes! But staff is not very nice, sometimes they are pretty rude and pretentious. it is very cold due to poor control of A/C temperature, it is generally dark-no windows and dark walls. And the art exhibit there... well, not my style at all.
But still, if you are looking for a nice and local coffeeshop in downtown Tempe, this is the only decent option.,Love this place!! Great coffee, ambiance and music.,Alright, alright.  

I had to update, just because my friend got me hooked on their iced chai. Holy s***, it is the most freaking fantastic chai I have EVER HAD, and I order that everywhere. GET IT.

I also tried one of their coconut chocolate cookies - not half bad, big flakes of coconut inside dark chocolate cookie.

The two male baristas I've seen have been cheerful and talkative, the girl is the only one who's a litte standoffish. 

Also, apparently if you pay with a card, they put an 'authorization' of some kind on - I ran my debit card, as credit, and instead of $3.50 it showed up in my statement as $6.50 for a couple days before correcting. The guy tried to tell me it was ""just like what gas stations do, to make sure the money is there', but I have never had that happen anywhere... strange, but it fixed itself... *shrug*.,Far and away the best latte I've ever had. They're doing everything right.,Walk over to Cartel at least 3 times a week from work and love it. My office sits right in between a Starbucks and Cartel. I don't even hesitate to move towards Cartel. The coffee is extremely superior. The atmosphere is perfect to bring a laptop and get some work done as well.,Simply put, Cartel Coffee Lab is the vanguard of coffee shops.  This is a scaled down, bare-bones shop that has a limited drink menu, for which I am thankful.  If you are looking for a frappuccino, or some kind of blended fruit concoction, this is not the place for you; the Cartel owners are true to the coffee bean, and they are not interested in manipulating or mutilating it.

Things I love about the Cartel: The chill atmosphere, the super-friendly staff, the premium coffee (obviously), and the independent feel of the place.  

Side note: This is not a coffee shop built around the whims of commuters who are in a rush to get to work.  They take great care at Cartel to make a great cup of coffee, which means that it might take a few minutes to get your order.,I love this place. The first time I came in here, I had never had a latte, except at crappy (Starbucks) or mediocre (Xtreme Bean) shops. When I took the first sip, I knew this was a whole different drink. A grin spread across my face as I got first a touch of light airy foam, then rich milk, and finally the smooth taste of the espresso. I thought I would get used to this, but I've been going there for nearly a year, at times almost every morning, and no matter what I get from there, it puts a grin on my face (except the agave latte, I can't believe people drink that). Even the non-coffee-snobby drinks like the vanilla latte, the chai or the mocha are brilliant. I don't go in as often as I used to now, because I buy their beans and make my coffee at home, mimicking their setup as best as I can.

As far as the service, yes it's true, there is some times a bit of attitude, but quite honestly, you're paying a little more to get a skilled person to make you a delicious drink of the caliber you can only get at a select few places in the valley. If you want a fake-smiling robot who doesn't know how to pull a shot, go to Starbucks. If you want a real human barista who will learn your name and your drink, and yes, maybe mock you a little bit for being a phillistine (and we all are sometimes), then Cartel is the place for you.

The only reason I only give it 4 stars is that they don't serve food. I think they said it's because they don't have a food license at this location or some such (and it might be kind of small for a cafe anyway), but it really would be nice to be able get something to eat here too.,Grabbed a coffee here today with a couple friends. Had an ""Iced Toddy"", which is their iced coffee. It was fabulous! 

Cool atmosphere. I loved the decor and local art. Will definitely stop by next time I am in Tempe and have a craving for some coffee. :),I'm noticing a trend in my recent reviews. Caffeine!

Best mocha I've had.... bar none. Of course I still love Miss Lola and Lux but if Cartel were closer to home (or the downtown location was open on Sunday) I'd be here all the time.

The wait is long no matter what time you come. Stop whining. Deal with it or go to Starbucks so I don't have to wait so long.

The decor is cool, the location is hidden and there is an abundance of chicks with mullets and dudes with neck beards, neither of which bother me. I had a strange verbal exchange with a barista that left me confused but I think that was due to my foggy Sunday morning state. I haven't experienced the snarky attitude that others have made mention to....and I'm pretty in tune with that sort of thing. Some would say overly so.

One more thing worth mentioning is that the music is at a decibel level that it's not a nightmare trying to hold a conversation. (take note Lux) As a matter of fact, I could hear the hilariously awkward conversation next to me. That's always fun...,Overrated, pretentious, and crowded. Why in the hell am I giving them 3 stars?

Okay, the coffee really is that good.

But, I'm the type of girl that needs a little more... cream, sugar, I like my additives--SUE ME.

You order a coffee, you pay for it, you ask politely, ""do you have any soy milk? half and half?""

*blank stare*

""Um... our coffee doesn't need that.""

Bitch! Please...

I love the fact that the baristas seem to be well-trained and well-versed in their coffee-knowledge. Yes, they really are super serious about it. Honestly though, Cartel could do with a bit of loosening up.,Went here with a friend a few months ago when I was in Arizona for a conference.

Was probably not the location I should have met him at. Why? Well, I was very definitely the oldest person in the place. He's more than 15 years my junior and was probably the second oldest. 

Coffee was very well done. If I lived in Arizona, I'd find and check out heir other locations.
Service was better than average but not superb.
Noise level was off the wall. We could barely hear each other.,Pretty cool little coffee joint.  I had me a shot of espresso along with what appeared to be club soda.  Definitely something new to me.  Espresso was super strong so I understood why the chaser was necessary.  Too strong for me actually and my friends told me the coffee there is extra potent.

Truthfully, I felt out of place being here.  This place was made for the following:

1. Students
2. Hipsters

I'm neither of the 2, but I can respect them.  Oh to be young and angry again!  Indeed, my neatly tucked in shirt and polished shoe is not welcomed - haha!  Good thing I didn't wear a suit might be mistaken for being ""The Man""!  

In any case, I gather this place is a wonderful spot for hanging with friends and study groups. - Enjoy!,really give it 3.5 stars.

to qualify myself, i'm not a fanatic but i refuse to drink bad coffee. i'd rather go for a red bull if i'm that desperate for caffeine. so while i'm no expert, i guess i'm a snob.

coffee was very good, but not mind-blowingly orgasmic per most of these reviews.

in town for work. always like to find a good alternative to S.bucks when i can. this definitely qualifies.

had an Americano. very bold and pretty smooth. came in around 10a during on a weekday. moderately crowded, but pretty good set-up for working.

wi-fi was totally fine. 

so overall the coffee was good and the place/people were fine and totally unremarkable. not sure what the fuss is about either way.,Best coffee in the Valley, let alone Tempe.

They roast their own beans on site (roasting days are heaven). At any given moment they'll have a dozen different beans available, and they'll offer you advice on which you might like based on your tastes. They'll tell you about the plantation each bean comes from (they buy limited batches directly from small producers). Then they grind YOUR beans in front of you and use a manual drip filter to brew your coffee while you watch. Cool artsy/hipster/gay/collegey menagerie of folks always there. And great music plus free Internet (though it took forever to get some kinks worked out last summer...).,I had a delicious latte here. They say they have the best espresso maker in town, and it's kind of hard to argue. This place is hipster supreme to the max and way better than any other coffeehouse in Tempe (sorry, Gold Bar, I've betrayed you). 

My favorite thing about Cartel (besides the strong brew, of course)? They play damn good tunes all the time. There's no better soundtrack in the Valley. They also have art for sale that's actually affordable (and usually quite interesting). And people are nice here... what a concept. I'm glad they're into the green movement using ""plastic"" cups made of 100% corn. Downside: I wish they had longer hours and more comfy chairs. Those plastic fold-up chairs really suck compared to the comfy couches.,I can't believe I haven't yelped about the place yet. Several months (maybe over a year?) ago my husband read a newspaper article about the Clover coffee maker and the one place in town that had managed to procure one. I was skeptical (as is my nature). It can't be that much better right? You're just saying it's amazing because you want to talk about the new hot coffee shop you discovered, right? Well, maybe. But I love this place. And I don't think it has a whole lot to do with the Clover. They roast their own beans and they roast them way differently than that other ginormous coffee chain - all a light or medium roast. Never bitter, never oily, never yucky. The coffee they make there is, obviously, the best. But I send my husband in every week now to buy a pound of beans so that I can approximate the same coffee at home. Add an edgy (though sometimes intimidating) seating area, great local art (which we bought off the wall), and smiley service...I'm sold. Can't wait to try out the downtown location.,Sitting at one end of the motel(?)-converted-strip-mall adjacent to Buffalo Exchange, finally found Cartel.  Ironically I heard a rave about it from Jeff M last year, and I'm glad I didn't have a chance to read his recent review.  I'm your typical social coffee drinker, so maybe I would of felt undeserving to grace the doors based on the flack, but my gal pal and I got no attitude what-so-ever.  

In fact the blond barista definitely knew her drinks and graciously explained away.  I didn't have to worry about an order faux pas with my iced mocha, but my friend definitely didn't get any flack when she hoped for a caramel macchiato offering.  Once advised it's not a la Starbucks style, she was gently steered into an agave-flavored ice latte.  Besides both drinks being awesome, I agree w/ Jeff -- it IS about service -- and this barista hit it right on.,They don't sell coffee here, they sell drinkable art.,First of all, let me state that I completely love Cartel. There's only two reasons that keep me from giving them 5 stars: the difficult to find location and the crappy wifi. Honestly, if the wifi rocked, that would probably be enough for me.

I call Cartel the ""accidental coffeehouse"". It started off as a roasting operation with a small espresso/retail component. Thanks to the ridiculously high quality of their coffee, they grew into a full-fledged coffeehouse.

The coffee Cartel roasts and brews is consistently some of the best in the valley. I am in love with their Black Market Espresso, which is a favorite of mine both at the shop and in the office when I brew my own.

Cartel provides all of the standard espresso beverages as well as iced toddy. However, they don't do any of the foofy blended drinks. Not only do I appreciate their commitment to classic coffee drinks, I also enjoy the freedom from hearing an insanely loud blender when I'm attempting to have a conversation.

There's also a couple of less common brewing methods available at Cartel. They have pour-over brewers which brew single cups. This enables them to offer any of their beans as fresh brewed coffee. Also, they have a Clover machine, which brews single cups on demand.

I do wish that Cartel served some pastries or other food, but Cartel is unabashedly committed to coffee, so I can't fault them for this.

The vibe at Cartel is a great mix of bohemian eclectic, which fits their proximity to ASU's main campus. The largely windowless interior makes it a great place to take refuge from the often brutal Arizona sun and enjoy a drink or two while hanging out with friends or getting work done.

Overall, Cartel is an excellent addition to the Phoenix coffee scene.,Finally getting around to trying this place as it has such high reviews and also was highly recommended by my barista/coffee snob sister.

Yes, I enjoyed my vanilla latte very much. Their espresso is excellent. I also had the coffee cake which was fresh and delicious. I also thought the decor was unique and interesting. Their espresso machine is a work of art in and of itself!

Things I wasn't thrilled about...if you're not a hipster or student you will feel out of place (because you are!). I walked in with my 2 year old son and felt like people were throwing daggers at me with their eyes. I also didn't appreciate the pretentious barista who seemed dead set on letting me know just how ignorant I was about coffee. They also don't post their prices which I thought was super annoying.

So basically I would give them 5 stars for their espresso, baked goods , and atmosphere. 0-1 for the customer service and I land at a 3 stars.,Very hipster location. Major college vibe (of course, ASU is right there.....so duh) But, very comfortable....there's always plenty of seating, even tho it's always busy. Some cool artwork too, I like the bike wheel partition wall and the hair drying chair....quirky.

As for the coffee....VERY GOOD..... it has excellent flavor with a smooth....texture?? I guess, does that make sense??? Anyways, it's not as strong as Starbucks, but their iced coffee is WAY better......and they let you add your own milk. I like that. But then again, maybe i'm a little controlling of a person.......

I wish they had more pastries, especially vegan ones. And, it's hard to find this place. You kind of just have to know where it is......(just look behind buffalo exchange) It looks like a hole in the wall from the outside, but quite surpirsing once you enter :),I am a major fan of your coffee. Enough said on this. 

I am less of a fan of your customer service- I would rather a smile from the cashier instead of some ironic stare.... but it's a pass.

I am requesting that you bring back non-sweet/sugar-filled baked goods. Such as croissants or toast. 

Some of us (the public) can't have sugar. Others of us choose not to ingest sugar filled muffins, cakes, and scones with our coffee. Please stock your store with an alternative that is not a packaged granola bar.

That is my feedback. 

Again- You do coffee well! Maybe I'll be forced to get a snack elsewhere.,I loved this place and the double-soy-cappuccino was one of the best I have ever tasted.  The Cap was made perfectly... awesome thick foam, tasty coffee, great cup (haha, srsly, the cup is great).  The inside is filled with art and has a cool vibe.  $2.50 for a double-soy-cap, not bad.  I just wish this place was closer to me, I'd be a regular.,I love Cartel. I work within 1 mile of Cartel, so I stop in there probably 2-3 times per week on average. The staff is always very friendly, even when they are slammed with customers. Sometimes the order line gets a bit backed up, but it because Cartel takes the time to make good coffee. I highly recommend Cartel for coffee lovers.,Okay, so its probably unfair for me to review cartel.  I went there to pick up beans.  It was pretty clear that the beans I was buying weren't roasted recently.  (They told me they were about to roast.)  But, I was desperate.  In all fairness, the beans smelled awesome. Yet, the taste didn't get close to the smell---not delicate at all---much more grocery store like.  I will go back and try when their beans are fresh.

Atmosphere looked great.  I was more than slightly (ehmmm) insulted when they suggested that I was dropping off my kid for college.  Last I checked, I wasn't nearly of that age group.,Cappuccino will knock your socks off.  Not exactly sure why, but think its the coffee used, the coffee/water ratio, and the creamy dense topping that I was told is milk, not cream. 

This place takes its coffee seriously.  NYT's had an article few months ago about NYC coffee shops improving their coffee: each cup made to order, no espresso's or capuccino's to go, foamed milk done per cup (vs prefoamed in big container), ideal espresso/cap ratios(no skimping on espresso grinds) etc.  The Cartel's coffees are as good or better than any I used to go to in NYC.,What's to say about Cartel?? If you've tried the coffee just once (no cream, no sugar. JUST THE COFFEE. And slurp it!) then you know that it's hands down the best coffee in the valley. Also, it's hipster and crap blah blah.,The barista warned me as I ordered that I was about to start an addiction. Two lattes and a hot green tea later, I am realizing the gravity of his premonition.

Cartel Coffee Lab has to be one of the coolest spots in Tempe. It is appropriately named as a place that would foster an addiction, and addicted I now am. It has the definite feel of an old warehouse. It is dimly lit, has high, exposed rafters and cooling vents, a concrete floor, and a usable garage door at the back. The layout is great, with a bar, several couches, and a good number of tables fully wired with plugs for the mac or pc-wielding crowd. It's a funky place, very urban; the main room is separated by an art installation made of bike tire rims. Cartel seems to attract a hugely eclectic group of patrons, from unbathed hipsters to ASU students to very cool coffee snobs. I sat next to the most interesting man, definitely a regular, and learned that he owns the old flour mill on Mill Ave! He also shared the most delicious almond cookie with me, baked by his father. Very cool. 

Yes, the coffee. The coffee and espresso are fantastic. People complain that the service is slow, but calmatevi amici, they are making the valley's best coffee, to order, and that takes time! Their beans are direct trade, roasted in house. Try the espresso - it's perfect. Regular coffee fan? They use the Clover, a single serve machine that makes every cup special, just for you. They will alternatively use this awesome manual system with paper filters to drip your coffee nice and slow. I like that they make you commit - large or small - and they keep their menu very simple, so you'll need to get your vanilla lattes elsewhere.  Their default milk is whole (so good), from a local organic farm - and so remember to ask for skim if you are watching that waistline. The baristas are super cool and friendly, and gave me a great welcome. 

Cartel is my new favorite caffeine haven. Thank you friend of a friend for the recommendation - I am a convert, and have definitely found my Tempe fix for a great, independent coffee house. I may have a hard time going anywhere else! (Don't worry Lux, you're still my first love, I promise.),This place seriously has the best coffee, lattes, hot chocolate and chai tea i've ever had, period!

I was visiting my brother and he insisted on taking me here, to which I replied, I only drink hot chocolate, no coffee or tea. Well, did i eat or should i say drink those words.

We ordered a latte, chai tea and hot chocolate and i was singing their praises all the way home. This is not an ordinary coffee shop - all three drinks were rich, creamy and had wonderful flavors - i was completely blown away!

If i lived here, i'd definitely be a coffee and chai tea drinker, but sadly i don't - though this place is on my ""must visit"" list next time i'm in town.,I recently lost my voice. My vocal cords have temporarily exited the building, and because of this.. I wanted some hot tea to sooth the pain from the sandpaper I apparently swallowed in my sleep Friday night. The location had been previously decided, and only wonderful things were spoken about it, so off to Cartel we go.. 

This joint is hidden. Had I been driving, I probably would have missed it. Also the parking situation is shit. My friend and I had to guide a 16 year old girl in her mothers boat of a vehicle, out of her parking space to avoid hitting the car that was illegally parked behind her, only to be honked and screamed at by (insert ASU douchebag here). idiots. We did get her spot though, which was directly in front of the entrance. Score. Upon entering, there are piles and piles of fliers and random magazines and also a box of what looked like dirty purses, staplers and shoes. I have no idea.. Anyway, there is radical art work and a sculpture hanging from the ceiling made of bicycle wheels, which was awesome and I want one! Plenty of unique reading material - I opted for the Best of The Onion, also lots of tables and couches full of the entire Indie population of Tempe. Most of these people happen to be Mac users, clearly shop at thrift stores, listen to the M. Ward station on Pandora and wear retro headbands, so I cant really complain. I too use a mac, love thrifting, love that station and have a sweet headband collection myself, so I don't mind this Hippie-esqe crowd. However, some people do.. If that's you, go to the corporate whore known as Starbucks instead. So basically I love the interior and the people that convent here. However, It was about 300° inside. It may have been cooler outside, and we all know how f-ing hot it is right now.. There was no way I was about to order a steaming hot tea while perspiring heavily. Annoyed, I get an iced ""Happiness Blend"" tea, which totally defeated the purpose of soothing my throat, but the tea was nice.. perfectly minty with a hint of daffodil. Everyone tried their hardest to have a sit down and enjoy the effects of caffeine and good company, but it was just way too hot in there, and so we were forced to leave. This situation needs to be handled immediately, otherwise there is no way I can hang out here unless its in January. That's really the only thing I have to complain about. I didn't try any of their coffees, but it smelled wonderful and the foam art that was being created was lovely.. I don't know why, but I just enjoy my beverage all the more when there is a foam heart floating on the top. Next time I'm at Eastside Records or Buffalo Exchange, I will walk over and get a coffee.. probably a Mocha and I'm actually looking forward to it too.,Well.. once again I trusted you dang Yelpers and once again you've proven yourselves worthy of that trust.  I'm sitting here in Cartel now just loving the smell of roasting coffee, the ambience, the music and one heckava cup of joe..I'll be back...my kinda place..,I've been here a couple of times to meet up with friends. It's my prefer indie coffee shop when I'm in Tempe. 

The coffee tasted awesome. The cups are big and prices about average. Tasted fresh, balanced, and wholesome.  The girl that works the counter would take the time to explain how they make the coffee and suggest which flavor would suit my taste .

The decor I thought was imaginative. The use of bike parts as a partition to keep the laptop users in the way back.. They have comfy sofas to lounge and talk. Plenty more tables in the front. The place overall was unique and clean. The music plays in the background, although a bit loud where it's tough to hold a conversation.

Most of the customers tend to be ASU aged students and the crowds are here for multiple purposes; totally non-threatening . This place also is difficult to locate as it is off the main road Universirty and tight and limited parking can be difficult.

On where it counts; the coffee, and a nice place to sit just for a while. This place keeps me coming back while I'm in Tempe .,Not that I would ever go to a coffee shop just to watch people...but here my friend and I kind of did. Ha! ok ok so there are alot of interesting people that come in this place. Nothing like I have ever seen atleast. Then again I am not into the college scene, so I don't know. But anyway. the coffee is super good. The cookies are amazing. This shop is definitely funky and cool. Not too cozy as far as big chairs or whatnot. So that's my only beef. But i would definitely come back to this place. And the staff was pretty darn friendly too!,BEST COFFEE EVER! ...Wait, BEST COFFEE PLACE EVER!

This is the type of coffee spot I've always wanted to find but never could. My search is over (kind of...I wish it was closer to me). You can tell that Cartel is passionate about their product. They put quality first, and it's evident in the flavor of the espresso, roast, grind, milk, steam, pour, etc. Therefore the finished product is always a masterpiece. The service is great too. I'd move into the place if they let me.,Amazing coffee! Great staff and a top rate enviroment.,Drinking coffee and Espresso has become my new hobby (or dare I say obsession) due in large part to the opening of this funky and original coffee Lab.  The passion of the owner, to stay true to traditional barista ways, is nothing short of extraordinary.  While enjoying one of their amazing drinks, the thought comes to mind, this is what coffee is supposed to taste like!!  Darn the behemoths of the coffee industry for herding us like cattle through their identical shops while shoving expensive sub par coffee our way.  I say no more!  I want to sip a perfectly made drink in a place that feels like home.  Cartel Coffee Lab is that place.  The sweet and fragrant smell of the freshly roasted beans lingers in the air.  I almost feel like the owner should charge for the smell alone.  Because the beans are roasted on site, you truly can not get a fresher cup of coffee anywhere.  There are no old pots of coffee hanging out indefinitely on their warmers.  Every cup of coffee is brewed fresh for around $1.  I know, don't even get me started on the prices!  Your buck is definitely getting ""banged"" at this place.  This place will not disappoint!!,",0.269525
Carmel's Coffee & Bakery,"When it finally dawns on you Over Easy is over-rated and poorly served sludge head on over to this joint.  Cozy with a makeshift charm about it, they have terrific food and friendly service.  The food is not rushed to your table, which is nice.  It also means they are doing it properly rather than trying to turn and burn the tables like the aforementioned dive.  Teas and coffees are stellar.  Prices are quite fair and the music is good too.,Great pastries.  Great fresh food.  Friendly folks. Cute atmosphere.  Love it 
Ordering can be weird when it's busy... And the self serve coffee fixings is not simple.  Ask for cream but sugar is out on table??? Annoying.,This place is too freaking cute!!!  The OJ is literally one of the best glasses I've ever had.  I had the typical eggs, bacon, and toast and it was amazing.  The bacon was crispy without being burnt, the toast had just the right level of buttery goodness and the eggs were folded such as a crepe and fluffy goodness.  I also tried a bite of the pulled pork burger which was amazing, and the touch of apple put it over the top.  Another plus was the garden patio area that feels homey like someones backyard.  I will definitely be back to this cozy establishment!,We had brunch here for the first time last weekend and it is SUCH a cute little place. Very quaint and unpretentious both inside and out, with eclectic decor and classic music playing (we heard several Beatles tunes while dining)

The staff are very nice - we were welcomed right away by a gentleman who seemed to be the owner or at least manager. He made sure to point out the breakfast items on the boards and made some recommendations when he noticed that it was our first time there. 

There is a counter right by the kitchen as well as a bar top within the dining room. Additionally, there are several 2-top tables set along a banquette on one wall. We did not sit out on the patio but it seemed cute - it is tucked behind the restaurant, the seating is not in front as is pictured in some of the Yelp pictures. 

We ordered the breakfast burrito, banana nutella crepes, and the simple breakfast (I can't remember what it was technically called - eggs, bacon, toast) The breakfast burrito was a good size and came with a little dish of salsa - I felt it definitely needed the salsa to complete the flavors of the dish (the burrito was a little bland but the ingredients were all good) The banana nutella crepes were yummy (it is hard to complain about nutella for breakfast) and the eggs/bacon/toast dish did it's job. The coffee was delicious. The only downer food-wise was the blueberry scone: it was a bit dry and not super flavorful. 
 
Pricing is pretty high ($36+tip for 3 of us), especially for a place where you need to help yourself to silverware (set up on a station to the side of the entryway) and that doesn't provide some small niceties like butter (for the scone) automatically. 

Lastly, we brought our 1-year old son, as we are wont to do for weekend brunch, and after ordering we discovered to our dismay that they do not have highchairs at the restaurant. We had not brought a stroller, because it is usually so bulky that it inconveniences other patrons, so we did not have a great solution for corralling a very busy toddler. We managed though, creating a space for him in the corner of the banquette, but it definitely made for a less relaxing brunch than we would have liked, especially at that price point. Now, perhaps it is one of those places that proudly does NOT encourage children (in fact there is actually a sign on the back porch that says ""unattended children will be given espresso and a kitten"", which is good natured but still pointed :) ) 

Anyhow, it was a nice spot, very picturesque with yummy food and coffee, and we will likely go back - perhaps with out of town guests  and when we can leave our peanut with sitters so that we won't have to stress about seating for him.,The french toast was delicious! Toddy was especially good,Coffee snobs will truly appreciate the coffee here!  I've had my 100th latte and every single one has been absolutely consistent, smooth and satisfying.  The blueberry muffins are delicious! The baristas have a funky cool chic and pleasant attitude.  A great addition to the Arcadia hood!!,Very quaint place with personable staff. I tried the Iced Toddy (love that for a beverage name, I couldn't help but think of ""Hot Toddy, Hot Toddy"" from Will & Grace :) It was quite flavorful. I added Skim Milk and Agave Nectar to it. Yum!
Had I not been on a very strict diet I'd have tried some of their delicious looking pastries...so in other words, I'll be back!,LOVED this place! Location is prime (parking is a tad tight, but ok), ambiance is adorable and staff is friendly and attentive. 

I had the croissant sandwich and only managed to eat half. It was huge and so were the scones that my friend enjoyed (and only ate half). 

I'm not a huge coffee coniossier, but I had a non-fat iced vanilla latte and it was delish. 

If you're looking for a small and convenient place for a breakfast meeting  - look no further. This is it!,I love this place!  So many high points - the breakfast is great - fresh squeezed orange juice, delicious scones.  I love a good Americano and they definitely do a great job.  Parking is a bit sketchy, but if you pull around to the back there are more spots.  I love that the owner is always working and actually seems genuinely excited to see me (and everyone who comes in!)  I love it - I need to come here more often.  I do wish they were open a little later, sometimes I like a late afternoon pick me up and they're always closed around 3pm.,Just visited this morning and had a great experience. The staff was friendly, and the coffee was great. I had a raspberry muffin and iced toddy. Muffin was large and full of flavor. The owner was kind enough to give me a sample of the toddy (iced coffee brewed for 24 hrs i believe) My husband got the quiche which was light and fluffy and I'll order next time for sure. I loved the vintage plates they give you, and the atmosphere is inviting and airy.  It is kind of a cramped space when busy, but worth any wait and maneuvering.,Cute little restaurant that serves up an excellent chai latte. Service was cheerful and very friendly, and they offer almond milk as well as soy for milk alternatives.  I was even given a sample of the chai concentrate to try out before it was made for me.  The chai had a nice mix of spices and had a smooth, deep taste.  We brought our dogs and sat on the patio, but the corner we were at had a lot of ants running around so they sat on our laps for most of the time.  

I'd definitely like to come here again to try more drinks and to try breakfast!,I really like this place. Friendly staff. Great location. Delicious mochas and super yummy treats. Very cozy inside. Will be back many times for sure! :),Locally-owned coffee shops are the best. Always looking for a new place to try, I heard of Carmel's from a graduate student of mine. Tired of going to LGO, I decided to give this a try today. 

I ordered a medium chai latte. It was delicious - and I only ever get them at Cartel's! The guy behind the counter added a hint of cinnamon (how did he know that's what I usually put in my coffee?). The extra ingredient did it justice. 

I went around noon today and the place was semi-packed. Great music (a little bit of Jack Johnson) and I had a great Tuna Salad. The owner (or so I think) was very friendly. I was studying and he came by to thank me for coming in, which was nice. Also, there's a small patio in the back for people who want to read and enjoy the nice weather before it hits 100 degrees. 

I didn't have my laptop, but on my iPhone I saw that the Wi-Fi was locked. I didn't ask for the password, but I'm sure they would provide it if needed. Parking was scarce. Hard to find, but manageable. Overall, I would definitely come again for the chai latte!!!,Seriously some of the best Iced coffee I've ever had (and I drink a lot of it!). They use a unique brewing technique for it and call it Iced Toddy. It takes the bitterness completely out of coffee. You will never go back to Starbucks after visiting this little hidden gem.,Of all the establishments that have been in this space, Carmels is the BEST.   Great pastries.   I am not an egg fan, but I heard others oo-ing and ahh- ing over the rest of the menu.   My only complaint was the drip coffee.   It had a chemically after taste.  It wasn't bad...it simply should have been better.   

The owner made me feel welcome immediately.  Not a requirement, but a huge plus.

Definitely a place to add to the rotation.,Great little coffee shop, staff is friendly, place is clean, and the Quiche was excellent.  Iced coffee was a little weaker than I like, but I like my coffee like mud. Carmel's is a little off the beaten path for me, so I would probably not go out of my way to get some java and baked goods from here, but would definitely stop by when in the area.,One of my favorite places to visit to start the day off right.  It's cute and charming, the coffee is smooth, and can't get enough of the baked goods and pastries.,This place has all the variables to be a hit. They have been open for about a year now and I have come here on and off for that amount of time. The best thing they have going for them is great coffee consistency. My toddy and americanos have been good every time. I would go as far to say they serve Lux coffee better then Lux does. However The pastries have been hit or miss. I think the key is to come in early when they are fresh out of the oven. 

Every time I have come in (once a month or so) I swear there is a whole new set of employees. This doesn't effect the coffee quality and customer service (surprisingly) as much as the food. I would think after a year the kinks of running a shop would be worked out and you would retain your team but not the case here.

But this is why Carmel's get 3 stars, they raised the prices and the food is not good enough to warrant the price hike. Their original prices along with great customer service and coffee consistency is what kept me coming in. This has changed though. Granted, the coffee is still good and ultimately that's most important but I am not going to go out of my way to drop by.,Adorable bungalow building: Check
Quirky, cute, mismatched thrift-store dishware: Check
Delicious, buttery, flaky croissant breakfast sandwich: Check
Super friendly staff: Check

I went here for the first time yesterday and thought it was great. My friend and I both ordered the croissant breakfast sandwich which was super delicious and filling. Even though I knew that I'd be full from the sandwich, I couldn't resist snagging a brown butter scone when I saw it was the last one. Definitely made the right decision on that one, I'm a sucker for brown butter anything and the scone didn't disappoint. My friend ordered the Iced Toddy which was really good-- spiced but mellow. I ordered a latte and didn't like it quite as much. The owner was super friendly and remembered my name for the 1.5+ hrs. my friend and I lingered in the shop. He even gave me a (delicious) orange-zest filled strawberry muffin on the way out! If I didn't live so far away, I would be here all the time. As it is, I'll definitely be back soon.,Disappointed..maybe it was an off day for them. Man behind the counter was rude, just not friendly. The scone was hard(I like them slightly soft). The coffee was ok. Wanted to like it but it didn't get better. Might give them another try, hope the service is better.,My new go-to spot in Arcadia. Pat (the owner) is almost always there to greet customers and make sure you have an excellent experience. The back patio is a great place to relax, go check it out before it gets too hot. Wifi, great espresso (the barista use to work at Stumptown in Oregon), nice staff, good food. Recommended to all, let's help this place succeed.,Small and inviting. Good Iced Toddy. Parking can be scarce. More spots out back.,Owner is super nice. Great coffee. Amazing bakery items. Yummy. Perfect coffee stop on the way to the airport.,What a great place!  I met a coworker here for breakfast a few weeks ago and had a great experience.  The employees were all super friendly, gave great recommendations and took good care of us.  The atmosphere is quaint and comfortable.  The food was excellent - great tea selection and delicious breakfast crepe!  I'll be back for sure!,I have only stopped in this little gem a few times, but each time has been a great experience.  I usually order a hot orange rooibos tea and a brown butter scone.  The space is small and cute, they have a fair selection of breakfast and lunch items, coffee/espresso and tea, fresh squeezed orange juice, and the staff and owner are always very friendly and helpful.  Me gusta!,I made a yelp account just so I could review Carmel's. Yes, that's how good my breakfast was this morning. I got the bacon and egg croissant sandwich. The croissant was perfectly flakey and buttery, the eggs over easy were full of flavor and the bacon was cooked exactly the way bacon should be, not overly or under. Carmel's uses  the high quality bacon if you're a bacon snob like me. The sandwich is surprisingly large and is enough to fill a hungry man.The picky eater I was with had the crepes and she was beyond satisfied, I stole a bite and it was delicious. I took two blueberry scones home for my roommates because they looked so fresh- They were gone in about 30 seconds of arriving home and said they were the best pastries they've had. I'm giving this place 5 stars because the food was above any expectations I could have hoped for and the interior was very comfortable and warm. (Love the bar setup if you're alone). The owner Pat was helpful and friendly. The person beside us ordered the traditional breakfast with sunny side up eggs and it looked great. Everyone seemed very content with their meals. WIll be back soon and highly recommend. I think this is a very good if not better alternative to the other great breakfast spots in the area, and that is saying something.,It's patio weather and Carmel's has a fantastic patio!  Fact.

They use Maya tea, from Tucson, in their chai.  Best tea out there. Fact.

The owner is super friendly and on-site daily. Love that! 

I didn't eat today, but the food looked amazing and there were lots of people there eating it, so I'm guessing it's pretty great.  I'll definitely be adding this place to my coffee shop rotation. :),So cute and truly best cappuccino I have had in Phoenix.  I have recently been going different places to study and read, and Carmel's my favorite place to go. They have a super cute garden patio in the back.  For some reason when I am there, I feel like I am on vacation. Leisurely sipping my perfect cappuccino, nibbling on a breakfast pastry, reading outside on the garden patio. I want to go tomorrow !

 I can't wait to try more of the breakfast food there, as it looks super tasty. Always jealous of everyone's food when it comes out of the kitchen.  

Oh yes, and they have free wifi too and comfy stools at the counter seating.,Me and my ""bestest friend"" went in for a cup of coffee, of course a muffin and a chat.  The latte was delicious. The strawberry muffin...YUM! 
I love it that the owner named the place after his mama.   
I'm all about supporting the local businesses. 
We'll be passing on a good word, hope it does well!,The owner is always very friendly. The space is designed very well and has a nice ""California feel."" I would definitely recommend coming here instead of La Grande Orange for coffee if you are in the area. The baristas are much better trained and they are always very helpful. Also, you can always get your drink very quickly at Carmel's, which makes this the go to place for business people. Definitely worth a try!!!,Meh.  Had the breakfast burrito, which was nothing special (eggs, bacon and cheese in a tortilla).  The pico de gallo on the side was the only thing that saved it from being totally bland.  Cute place, blah food.,While on vacation, I found this place thanks to yelpers. I had a caramel soy latte & a bacon w/ a scrabbled egg croissant sandwich. Yum, simple, just as I would make it. 

Fresh baked goods. Nice employees--- I think it was the owner that I was talking to, very nice & helpful.

If I lived here I would be a regular.,This is my favorite coffee shop. I go here EVERY Wednesday after stopping at the Town & Country farmer's market, and lately I've been convincing the parents to join me for brunch after church on Sundays. Guess you could say I'm a regular.

I always order the same drink because it's just so good - iced almond milk mocha. Sometimes I'll get a little crazy and add some caramel. Watch out. 

Everything I've eaten there has been fantastic (and I've eaten a lot). If you've been to Paris and you are aching for a croissant, but those huge undercooked limp things in the Starbucks refrigerator case just aren't doing it for you - you have to have one at Carmel's. Perfection.

Make sure to go out back and enjoy your latte or crepes. They made the best out of that little area. 

Pat, the owner, is awesome. I love chatting with him about old music. One day I came in and he was snacking on a fresh orange behind the counter - he randomly just stuck out the plate to me. I remember that just putting a huge smile on my face.

Little things go a long way....and Carmel's is full of them.,Carmel's is my new favorite coffee/breakfast spot. If I didn't work during the day, I would enjoy their lunch too! The baristas are friendly and always smiling (HUGE in my book, especially early in the morning), and you can taste the love that the bakers put in their food. :) The crepes and brown butter scones are my go to as of now, I still need to work my way thru the menu. I love that it lacks the annoying crowds that i dread facing at other restaurant/cafes, although I know it's just a matter of time before word gets out that this place is the real deal.,Think of it as LGO lite; a nice breakfast alternative that doesn't ask that you park 5 blocks away.  The limited menu is good, the ambiance comfortable, and the art worth buying.  One gripe is that the prices seem a tad high for a place that puts off such a bohemian vibe.,The same way artist appreciate fine art, coffee connoisseurs are passionate about their contemporary cafés. The locals come to this little house to drink, play and for fellowship. It's a beautiful shop.

I am on a cappuccino trend so I order up one in a porcelain cups. The coffee taste so much better than a paper cup. Even as coffee drinkers, it is our responsibility to take care of the earth.

The staff is friendly and the aromas in the air is pleasant.,Really love this place.  Drive from Scottsdale every Sunday to have coffee and breakfast.

The coffee is good and well made.  I really like the cold tody.
The food, overall, is very good.  I love the breakfast croissant .  I was disappointed in the french toast and the crepe is not a crepe by any means.

The service is very friendly and it's a fun place to hang out for a bit on a Sunday morning.,I'm still a fan. But I went back and the delicious brown butter scones were gone. As was the pastry chef. Why ruin a good thing?! I will go back as I hear they got a new chef that is making yummies in the oven.,Great coffee, service-oriented staff who really seems to enjoy their customers and working there, and a very cool retro-but-not-over-the-top vibe, including a ""recycled"" back patio just opening up.  Baked goods made fresh on premises include to die for brown butter as well as blueberry scones.  And perfect, generous sized (and reasonably priced!) quiche if you need more substance.  Free wifi, good music mix and very entertaining owner (say hi to Pat when you come in - you'll know who he is) makes it a very frequent stop!,When I read the latest Phoenix New Times, I got really exited about this place. More so that it carried Cartels coffee. So when I went to visit I brought the most intense cappuccino connoisseur I knew. I walked in, and was instantly inthralled with the place, it's perfect, just how I would want my local coffee shop to be. (And bonus points, has some food options as well). Unfortunately, the shots were burt beyond drinkability, and the crape that we ordered was below par. Even my iced latte was not all that good, well it wasn't good I'm being nice. 

If they gave more effort into teaching the baristas how to not burn the shots, or maybe just some training in general with the espresso machine, I'd be a regular, and also would let everyone know just how amazing this place is.,Excellent food, service, patio, vibe.

Had the ""Regular"" for breakfast - sauteed veggies and eggs with some great toast. $8.  You order from the counter and they bring it to your table.

This place is one of the better breakfast spots around.  A MUST try.,Really cute place!  Great atmosphere- we see the owner almost every time we're there.  Menu is simple and good.  We get the breakfast sandwhich and ice lattes or ice mochas every time.  Most of the time the food is really great, only every once in a blue moon they must have a substitute cook who is not as good as the normal one.  Usually we have breakfast here on weekends!  Highly recommend!,Carmel's has a cute house atmosphere with plenty of seating and a band of regulars that makes it a really fun, intimate place to go. The croissant sandwiches are delicious and not too pricey for what they are. This place used to be Chestnut Lane and they really did a great job making it their own with the redecoration. Also, I hear a liquor license is pending - does this mean mimosas are in our future? I hope so!,I wanted to wander around ""La Grande Orange"", but of course the parking lot was full. I drove around and found this treasure instead. Outside it looks like a little cottage (with cat claw climbing up one side of it! tres magnifique!) with quaint french white and blue furniture for a coffee on the patio. There actually was a table of Frenchmen doing such on my second visit! 

Inside the tables have bright flowers in little vases. (see attached photo) Annnnnd there was a chalk elephant and monkey on the floor! Art house oils on the walls enhance the aesthetics. It just has this simple and wonderful charm. 

There were whole fresh strawberries embedded in my muffin. So goooood. It had those flaky crumbles on the top too. In front of the pastries are little placards. They have descriptives like ""elegant"" or ""scrumptious"". The owner smiled and said his girlfriend is in PR and she's responsible for that. I thought it was beyond endearing. 

The owner, in fact, is really amiable. He asked my friend and me if we'd like to see the patio. It's not ready yet for sitting... But! He plans to paint it ""terracotta like"", plant some bougainvillea, buy some hotel valley ho inspired umbrellas, plus misters for the summertime. I absolutely cannot wait. 

Oh! The Iced Toddy was pretty damn good. It had complex nutty and chocolate undertones. 

Right now the place is only open from 6AM-3PM. But I think it's going to blow up soon and have to extend its hours.,The only thing I can write a review on is the breakfast croissant I ordered and the ambiance. 

First off, the decor is cool and I like the quaint little coffee house with surprising seating inside. The outside seating is a little less appealing being pretty much right on Camelback. Has a great feel to the place. 

The Breakfast Croissant was fairly plain. You would be much better off getting a La Grande Commuter Sandwich. The croissant seemed store bought and I only got like one strip of bacon on it. Probably don't need it so I guess not too bummed about that. 

Hopefully the food can be improved. I will give the coffee a try next time and update my experience at Carmel's.,Wish I could give Carmel's a higher rating as I had high hopes for it to be a favorite. 

Pros: Great location, wonderful hot beverages, super friendly staff.
Cons: Food just isn't that tasty. Our party of 4 were all disappointed. One had quiche (bland), 2 had an American style breakfast with eggs over easy (both orders over cooked), and I had a strawberry muffin(dry).

I've only been there once, so weigh that in your choice to give it a try.,I just have to say, Carmel's has the most appealing, least obtrusively horrible art of pretty much any coffee shop in the valley. Go, you guys! (Thoughts of Portlandia, anyone?)

Digressions aside, we ventured over to Carmel's to give their coffee and brunchisms a shot over the weekend, and were all pleased. The breakfast crepe with tomatoes, eggs, goat cheese, and spinach was definitely the stand-out, but the breakfast croissant and egg white omelet got ravaged, as well.

However, when we ordered half-caff almond milk lattes, the girl at the counter went, ""umm... okaay...."" (motions to barista) ""do you know what 'haaalf-calllf' is???"" To which he replied, ""Yes."" They turned out to be the best in the area I'd say, *turns nose up at LGO* so that all worked out, but we laughed about it for the next 20 minutes. Half-calf? Like part baby cow milk, part grown-up cow milk? He-he-ha-ha-ho. No. But again, I digress.,The locally-owned joints are the ones that steal my heart -- as long as it's good.  I tend to stay away from the big chains, opting for the local holes-in-the-wall and their unique ambiance and flavor.  Carmel's is good on the food as well as ambiance; the coffee, however, wasn't what I was hoping for. The breakfast croissant was delicious, but the coffee needed considerable help from Splenda. 

Some positives: The people behind the counter were very nice. There's a bar area for single people like me who don't want to take up a whole table. Nice flat screen TV, and free water pitcher with cups. 

Some negatives:  There appeared to be Wi-Fi, but it was locked and the password wasn't given or available. Parking is extremely tight -- I had to park way in the back.,very cool little spot that I had never really noticed after passing for years.  Very glad I finally went into this little gem.  I'm not holistic at all but some places just have good energy and this is one of them.  People were all very nice and the service was great.  

Food was also good, the menu is limited, but everyone should be able to find a few things that spark their interest.  Also ordered a couple of drinks from the espresso bar that came out great.  Overall, I'm glad I tried this place and will be back again for sure.,I had high hopes for this ultra cute bungalow coffee house and bakery.  Walking in I loved the eclectic style of art and feel to the place.  Even the dishes are a mix of grandma's high tea to casual plastic cups.  The breakfast and lunch menu are a small which I actually think is a plus in a small place like this. I figured with a small menu you would master these few dishes making your coffee shop even more appealing.  But to my dismay this is where the coffee shop lost it's charm.  The quiche was odd.  Weird to say that but it was and I LOVE QUICHE!  But the consistency was undesirable.  It was like flan and turned into mush in my mouth.  It also only had a few veggies on the top layer but not throughout.  I think (and this is only speculation) but it may have had some cream of mushroom or something as the base.  It was just not very good.  I ate about an 1/8 and threw it out.  I felt terrible about wasting the food and money.  My boyfriend had the croissant sandwich with bacon and eggs.  Again, it was a let down.  It was super boring and it could have easily been made in my own kitchen.  As for the coffee, since this is a coffee house, was also not what I would have expected.  The iced coffee was super watery.  It had a decent taste but it lacked boldness.  We also tried the lattes the day before and they were nothing to get uber excited about.  Really let down because reading the reviews and seeing the place for myself it seemed like a charming urban coffee shop.  It definitely has potential if they could master the dishes and more importantly the coffee.,I was tickled with excitement when I learned about the arrival of this new local caffeinated business to enter Aracadia, so of course I had to drive right down and see if it was worth the excitment. To sum up this review, yes it was, but let me explain a little bit more in depth. 

The little cottage surrounded by welcoming tables and chairs in its front yard practically smiled at me as I walked up. It was around 4:25 PM as I walked through the doors. As I entered, the barista looked up and said they were closing. Tear. She must have noticed my look of disappointment, because she asked me what I was planning on ordering. When I mentioned that I was planning on getting an iced coffee, she pleasantly said that she could assist and welcomed me inside. Phew! So with that, the customer service earned this shop a point right off the bat. 

The coffee shop is intimate and quaint. It has the memory of the former tenants yet they've rearranged the interior to give it their own coffee shop twist. To the right, I noticed several small booths perfect for an afternoon of working. I was impressed at how many tables they fit inside, considering the size of the cottage. I wouldn't suggest that you meet here with your study group of ten, but if it's just you or maybe one or two others, it's a nice little spot! 

Baked goods such as muffins, pie and scones lined the counter. I was tempted, but I knew dinner was just around the corner so I fought temptation. Next time though! I ordered the medium iced toddy. Normally I drink iced coffee with non-fat milk and a hint of sugar free syrup. This toddy would have worked without either, but I couldn't avoid adding at least a little non-fat milk to it. The coffee was good and had the caffeine kick I needed to get me through the day. I also like the fact that they use Cartel products. 

I like Carmel's because it has the Downtown Phoenix coffee shop vibe for the Arcadia crew. It isn't stuffy in there, it doesn't feel like your typical corporate coffee shops that surround Arcadia and Scottsdale and it has a nice independent feeling that fills this cottage with character. Once I walked inside, I would have never guessed a Jack-in-the-Box was just next door. 

I think this is a perfect location for this coffee shop and it'll be nice to stop in and grab a drink and baked item...and probably stay and work for a little bit too! 

Thanks for opening your doors Carmel's!,Very quaint coffee spot, that also serves breakfast and lunch. Their coffee is consistently good and they have almond and soy options for lactards like me. I've had both their breakfast sandwich and tartine which they were able to make lactose free (sans butter) for me, both were made using fresh veggies and herbs. I now crave these dishes on a regular basis.",0.320846
Bunna Coffee,"When you've had enough of Starbucks support your local Free Trade Coffee shop.  It's the only mom and pop coffee nook I've ever been to that has strong delicious fresh coffee every day.  

The owners did plenty of research to get it that way and the taste proves it was worth the effort!!,I love this place and I love the owners. They are great people and good friends. Thanks for opening the place. 

JR,I finally was able to get here to eat before 2pm. I saw all the raves and had been planning to give it a try. 
Right off it wasn't exactly what I expected. Less of a restaurant than I thought it'd be. You order at the counter, so if you come hungry, it's a bit of pressure to figure out what you want. A waitress and menus on the table would make a difference I think. The interior is nice, some photographs displayed that weren't total crap like I'm used to seeing at coffee shops. The girls at the counter were definately one of the highlights for me. Super nice without being annoying or fake. 
Had some really healthy menu choices. Definately be back to try the organic waffles. The coffee wasn't the best Ive had, but being a fair trade coffee house makes up for it. The tropical smoothie was f'n delicious. The breakfast wraps we had were tasty, but not quite hot enough. 
So, a little room for improvement, I'll give it another try in a while.,I've been here a few times over the last week or so, and the daily choices for drip coffee have been fantastic. I love the variety, and each kind has been full of flavor. I've had a few of the pastries as well, which weren't really anything special, but that's okay; I personally come just to seek my morning coffee, and am more than pleased.,I live in the neighborhood right across the street from this place and recently started going there. It seems like everytime I go in I see one of my neighbors. How is it I didn't realize it was there? 

 This is a cool coffee shop. It has an artsy feel to it that makes it fun and cozy. It's a warmer environment than Starbucks. I recommend this place. The coffee is very good, but it's the atmosphere that I love.,This is a great little place to get some coffee and a snack, and to hang out.  The employees make the place nice - they're friendly and prompt.  They have good coffee, but lately I get herbal teas for personal reasons.  

I've been gluten-free since September 2007, and they don't offer a ton of options for that, but what coffee house does?  They have a GF granola and snack bar (at least, it didn't set me off; they can't guarantee it's gluten-free).  Wheaty options include sandwiches and pastries; other foods include yogurt, Naked juices, bananas, and apples.  They have organic products when possible.

The temperature inside is fine.  Not too many comfy chairs and such, but there are chairs and tables for hanging out, working, reading, etc.  They mitigate those office-like fluorescent lights with cute covers.  There's art for sale on the walls, like other independent coffee houses.

Why 4 stars, not 5?  It's just not that awesome an experience to come here, but I don't know what I'm looking for in a coffee house for 5 stars.  Nothing personal for Bunna.  I'm glad they're here.

Hours vary according to the ASU student population.  Expect early closings in the summer.,I went here today for some coffee and maybe something to eat.  

The door was opened for me upon approaching it, and I was warmly greeted by a man who I assumed to be the owner.  That was awesome.

Getting inside, there are children crawling around on the ground and on furniture, literally screaming... and it smells.

I walked up to the counter and a girl said ""hi,"" I said, ""hi,"" and I looked  up at the menu to see what I wanted... I kept looking and kept thinking and she remained silent and just stared at me.... this is not the kind of service I expect at a coffee shop... maybe some suggestions, or questions... ""so is this your first time here?"" would have been nice.  Just silence.

I ended up just ordering a toddy, and it was okay.  I prefer the ones from Cartel most definitely though. 

I went to throw my straw wrapper away and the counter with forks and condiments and sugar and whatnot was visibly sticky and gross.  There was a bin with a sign over it reading ""dirty dishes,"" that was indeed FILLED with dirty, smelly dishes.

The owner thanked me and said goodbye on my way out.,If you're gunna grab a coffee grab a Bunna.  Here's why you're gunna grab a Bunna:

-You're gunna wanna chat with the nice folks at Bunna.
-Their coffee is very good and shade grown but you can drink it in the sunna.
-Here at Bunna they really know their stuff and you can get toddy at Bunna.
-It takes real coffee expertise at a coffee house to even know what toddy is - go to Bunna and try it.
-Gabi's office hours at Bunna brought me here in a roundabout way.
-Meet with a friend is what I was gunna, he said hey let's meet over at this place I tried with Gabi, do you know it, it's called Bunna.

*Toddy - coffee brewed by soaking the grounds in cold water for 12 hours or so, then draining off the liquid.  The result is highly caffeinated, very smooth, concentrated coffee which can then be used in drinks in place of espresso or consumed on it's own.  It is very smooth because no hot water or steam is used as in regular brewing methods and the bitter acids that are released from the beans by heat are not present in the toddy.,I'll be honest: I've only been here twice. But both times, the baristas have been friendly and intelligent...and they properly pull an espresso shot and make a mean iced toddy (sometimes, the temperatures are too high here for a hot americano...). 

Most important for me, they have awesome beans to take home and feed to my grinder and french press - try the Brazilian Blue and the Mexican Chiapas.,Found Bunna doing a fast search for coffee in Tempe and the reviews all seemed nice enough that it just made sense to give them a shot. Located in a non descript strip mall, like everything else in phoenix, Bunna is a super chill atmosphere with lots of tables and free Wifi for hanging out and getting stuff done.

The Wifi speed is just over 1Mbps when i tested it, not awesome but not bad either.,I love Wildflower Bakery in this part of town...and I eat there entirely too much. Being there on my day off was not an option. The Dennys...was no longer in effect. A strip mall sign caught the eye-Croissants? This could be worthy.

We pulled up and walked past a place that promised Fair Trade Coffee, charming cafe tables with a sullen 12 year old kid with his iPod reading the New Times...and walked over the croissant place-the pastries looked delish but the atmosphere was...eh...unappealing? So we went actually inside Bunna to a really nice cozy space! Walls painted blue, plum and apple green; various small couches, some high tables (guess who didn't sit there!), and some low large round tables. One table had like ten senior citizens laughing it up, there were intense types on their lap-tops, and a massive sign showcasing all their coffee drinks. However, they only had cold breakfast stuff, so we asked if we could bring over sandwiches from Pleaissant Croissants-and she first said ""Um, no you can't!.....Ah ha! Of course you can!"" I went from sheer panic to elation-this place has FLAVA.

I ordered just plain coffee (with a bizarre aside, was served in a blue ceramic IKEA coffee mug that just happens to be MY favourite mug I use for coffee at my house...in fact I am drinking out of it RIGHT NOW) while my companion had a mango naked juice. This time around I got to browse around-def. has hippie vibes-there was Ten Thousand Villages merchandise there, hippie soap, incense, teas and coffee beans for sale and some hemp bags. Their pastries did look yummy and they had what I call ""bird seed treats"" for all the granola heads. In the cooler they had all the naked juices, Virgils root beer, Hansens soda, I mean so many drink options I kinda had to block it off. Also some delectable sprouts and fruit salads in the cooler as well. 

But don't get me wrong-as hippie as it was, it was extremely comfortable, nice, and CLEAN. 

With Three Roots closed for the rest of the summer, I will definitely make this my cafe of choice.,Great little shop - good drinks, nice people. Good place to get some work done in a small, usually very quiet, place.,Great atmosphere on the inside with green coffee bean bags on display, and a nice assortment of beans as well as tea for sale.  Three choices for drip coffee, and espresso was fairly good as well.  Prices weren't too bad, and parking wasn't a problem.  Only negative is that it isn't a very nice strip mall.,For the sake of my budget it's a good thing that I don't live in walking distance to Bunna. From the first step into Bunna I can always count on being welcomed by the warm nutty aromas of their organic coffee. 

Their customer service may even be better than the intoxicating aromas. I can always count on a caffeinated barista's, ""hello, you take two shots, right?"" to snap me out of an aroma coma. I've only recently discovered Bunna and they already know that I like two shots of espresso in an extra dry cappuccino.  

You can tell that their baristas enjoy what they do and like being there. They are well trained, friendly, and can consistently make a good extra dry cappuccino. I can taste the slightly sweet and feel the velvety texture of the foam that floats on top a very clean tasting espresso as I type.

Why then the 4 stars? They do a great job supporting local businesses and the organic lifestyle but their menu lacks in creativity using seasonal produce. 

But mostly, and if they did I don't know what would happen to my budget, I wish they sold fresh baked goods. That would be heavenly for me and 5 stars for them if they sold perfectly flaky and warm buttery croissants to go along with their perfectly prepared cappuccinos.

Ps. I know that there is a croissant bakery next door but that's another review that I will not be writing anytime soon, or ever.,After reading Jim's review of this place, I wanted to go check it out.  I cruised in there on Sunday, and was surprised to see that it was almost empty.  It was just me, one other girl and the guy behind the counter.

I have to say, I really liked this place.  Clean, decorated, comfortable and easy to manuver.  2 tops and 4 tops, theres plenty of seating!  The guy behind the counter was super cool and friendly!  I liked him.  They seem to have a real nice menu here, quite a few options of food and drinks.  I went with a cup of coffee amd it was TASTY! (coffee at a coffee shop? *GASP* I KNOW SHAME!)  

Anyways, they also seem to have decent hours.  No late nights like the other places, but I like it enough that I am willing to drive a few miles to get here.,Why am I cursing Italy this week? I've made it through stints as a journalist, a political wonk, a gen x-er, and a northwest grunge girl and I've never succumb to the temptations of coffee. But this last vacation has me hooked on macchiattos - that tiny little cross breed of a cappuccino and an espresso. 

And while I'm at it I should also curse the Yelp Office Hours because that's how I heard about Bunna Coffee. I never would have seen this friendly space tucked behind the DQ on Rural and Elliott otherwise. And I never would have been tempted back by Bunna's exchange rate affordable macchiato ($1.35 is about the same as 1 euro these days.) 

The free wifi ensures I will come back to Bunna for some work away from work time, just like that spot of milk and foam turned a random ""act like the locals"" experiment into my latest craving.,Stopped by Bunna to read for a bit and try out their new horchata drink. Sadly, they were out of this new drink being advertised by an outdoor sign. Ended up ordering a strawberry smoothed for 4.50 and it was okay, just okay. My fiance ordered a coffee and although it had a fancy name it tasted like any other cup of joe to me. The owner and I were the only ones in the place for a little while so he was nice and showed me around the store. I noticed this place sells stuff that I buy from Costco. Two things I know they get from Costco and then just put on a plate for way more than the original price are the cinnamon roll bites and the black bean burger. I'd rather just buy this stuff from Costco then go home and make my own coffee.,I spent the morning at Bunna Coffee and stayed through today's Yelp Office Hours.  I was super impressed with the number of 'regulars' in the place and how most of them were known by name.

The atmosphere is welcoming, the coffee is fabulous, and the food is fresh!  I had a big bowl of fresh berries (blueberries, blackberries, and strawberries), granola (some of the best I've had ever), and organic yogurt along with a cup of sumatra (medium roast) coffee with some steamed almond milk on the side.

That was the fuel that got me through my morning.  I am happy to see a local business thriving (or at least it appears that way).  I wish Bunna was a tad bit closer to where I live because I'd like to be a regular there too!,I went to Bunna last week to hang out at their Tuesday open mic, do some comedy, and meet new people. The patrons were very cool. It is a BYOB coffee shop, and people were drinking beer and wine. If you are looking for a chill place to sip on something, this seems like a spot to hit. The owners and staff were extremely friendly.


I had a spinach and berry smoothie...it was good and cost about the same as a smoothie anywhere else costs. They have a funky decor with work from local artists on the walls. I will definitely go back and try their coffee and food.,Bunna coffee has quite the following, but I thought it was only ok.  The barista was really nice and helpful.  I had a mocha and a banana nut muffin.  The muffin was a bit dry.  

The environment was not so pleasureable and I think it was just for that day.  The AC was on so the establishment was freezing.  Then this girl set up her office in there.  People were dropping off papers and it was kind of loud.  She was not using her inside voice and her voice carried.  I'll try Bunna again for coffee, but that's about it.,Stopped in on the Yelp Office hours because it's fairly close to where i work. nice little coffee shop. i ordered an iced americano and the espresso didn't taste burnt or bitter. 

also in attendance this day was blue belle ice cream. delish new flavor.


if your in the area, check it out.,In the interest of brevity (it being the soul of wit, although possibly not witticisms:), I will keep my review of Bunna brief.
I only had one cup of coffee...the Guatemalan Dark Roast, but WOW...good coffee!

Good enough for Bunna to inspire another haiku - 

a cup of dark roast
makes my heart beat much faster
with love, not caffeine

Good Coffee!,Came here on the way out of Phoenix and had an amazing special iced coffee called a Toddy.  They cold brew it for 24 hours which retains all of the flavors and caffeine, but because there is no heat involved, you don't get any of the bitterness that you would find with an espresso.  It's super caffeinated though--I drove back to LA high and wired!  I got the spiced version, which has subtle flavors of clove, cinnamon, and cardammon(?)

The owner was so nice and even explained to me how a Toddy is made.  They even have supplies in the store if you want to try and make your own at home.  Everything in the store is FAIR TRADE and ORGANIC.  You can also purchase loose leaf teas and coffee beans by the pound.  I got 2oz (about 10-12 servings) of Blueberry Rooibos tea for $5!  What a steal!

Definitely check this place out--I read a sign on the door that said they are trying to change ownership, so hopefully this place will not go by the wayside.  There's yummy breakfast wraps for $4 and the bagel with homemade sundried tomato and basil cream cheese ($3) was also a great way to start my morning.  

Support Bunna Coffee and organic/fair trade goods--'nuf said!,Oh how I love discovering coffee places to go to besides Starbucks! And this place is GREAT. The atmosphere is relaxed and there are all sorts here, not just hipsters. Everyone that works here is so nice  and helpful. the owner has been there every time I've come in and he goes above and beyond, bringing your food/drinks to the table and even grabbing the silverware you forgot to get for you. 

We've only had the pancakes here and they were a mix from TJ's I'm pretty sure so not amazing... but they have veggie burgers here yay and I can't wait to try one. 

The coffee is really good. I'm an iced coffee or latte girl and they are accommodating about making mine with soy! The BF goes for the blended drinks and those have been scrumptiously dessert like. There iced teas are really good too and they always have a great suggestion for you to try. They will mix any of them to concoct your dream iced tea.

I love this place bc it's yummy, fairly priced, and a LOCAL, small business!,I wish this was closer to home! Small artistic coffee shop with an awesome Toddy.  I also ordered a breakfast wrap and was happy with the fresh ingredients. I plan to make the trip as often as I can.,Love Bunna Coffee!!  This little coffee shop is right by my parents' house and I totally enjoy making it a destination for a morning walk with Reggie.  

The people working there are always so nice!  

I recommend checking it out and supporting a cute local business!!!,So, my mom was in town and I needed a place with coffee, a conscience, and wireless.  Bunna, basedon on Bonnie's review, seemed to be a good match.  It also isn't far from Wildflower (a mom-fav).  So we marched on down there with laptops, I made her proofread my personal essay for a felloweship application, and we munched on scones and drank our drinks.  The coffee surpassed my test:  it did not suck and it did not upset by digestive system (as Starbucks is wont to do).  The place was chill, the barista (who I think is also the owner) pretty much knew everyone there (except us first timers).  It was cheery and not so hipster-y as to scare away my mom. and they weren't irritated that we sat there for sooo sooooooooo long.  I might make this one of my Saturday spots when I have to do work but  don't really want to but really need to.  Why three stars?  I kind of wished they had a lunch menu.,Wow ...have been hesitant to come back since under new management. (I new old owner, Anthony,  from high school and live sooooo close) But stopped n real fast for my green T fix, since I didn't have time to drive to my fav..xtreme bean. New owner is so nice,he took time and told me all about new menu and different.L Evening events they have started like BYOB and open mic. also live music some weekends....I will b back with my Hubbie to check out new grub offerings soon,Bunna coffee is my local coffee house.  The owners are lovely, the coffee is tasty and served beautifully in wonderful big mugs, and the food and service are always and dependably great too.  Despite it being housed in a strip mall (and what isn't in the valley, right?) the ambiance here is charming and I generally linger longer than necessary due to the relaxed feeling I get while sipping my yummy espresso drinks.  Also, the coffee is fair trade, which makes it worth 5 stars.,they are now a drop-off point for Chef-to-Chef bags. (one of those organizations that you pre-order bags of local farm produce from).,Wohooo I am happy to announce that Bunna Cafe has moved to Gilbert. Their relocation makes me feel like a child on Christmas morning. I am that excited. If you have been to Gilbert, you know that our options here are limited, to put it kindly. Bunna Cafe has a great selection of sandwiches, wraps, and drinks. I love that it is run locally and offers organic and fair trade coffee. We need to support our local Arizona families in their business. We can change the economy and stimulate community growth if we support our neighbors. Sorry for getting side tracked, but did I mention there is free wi-fi? There are also plenty of tables and chairs to sit back and enjoy. They offer student and senior discounts as well. This is a must try place. Yayyy for mom and pop shops, booo corporate coffee giants (aka Starbucks). 

PS. Their customer service is excellent!,I came here a couple weeks ago to get some coffee after hearing good things about this place. The coffee was just not very good. It didn't have a lot of flavor and just was meh. I might have high expectations after living in Seattle, but this coffee wasn't even as good as dunkin donuts.... so.... I'd pass.,Keep on driving by.........

I don't understand the high reviews.   I've been here twice just to check myself.

Both coffee and espresso have no taste.

To boot, wireless does not work well.  I had to use a neighboring business.

Move on to the next place.......,Thank you Bonnie for this great find!  I've spent the last two days there. They have a different brew available everyday.  Yesterday had a Brazilian one and today a Peruvian one. They were both delicious, but, the Peruvian one was a bit strong. They do a little blurb on where it comes from located on the dispenser. Very cute touch!   The wifi is great and a pretty fast connection.    However, on busy days its kind of a fight for the plugs as there is only 2 on each wall.  I even thought of bringing a multi-plug wall adapter to share with everyone. next time gadget next time!  Staff is young and delightful.  oh and a clean bathroom is a plus. :)Definitely going to BE my new favorite cafe!,Have only had a couple chances to visit Bunna Coffee even though it's ridiculously close to my house because I am usually in downtown Tempe for work. I have had the pleasure of visiting here twice, once for an interview and once to catch up on some work. Both times I just grabbed an ice coffee but was impressed on both occasions, although this place is no Lux Coffeebar or Cartel Coffee Lab, this hip little joint has a fine brew. Since then I have fallen in love with the cozy warmth of the cafe, with the IKEA furniture and bright and sunny colors. I will indeed make it a point to visit this place again as soon as I get another chance.

EDIT: I would visit %100 more if they were open for more than an hour every day.",0.241892
Boba Tea House,"Was here on a Saturday afternoon.  WOW, the place was popping!!!  It is bright, colorful, and clean.  The menu is on the wall.  There are so many things on it.  I settled with a Thai Iced Tea Slush + boba.  The bobas were soft and a good texture.  I am interested to try the other items on the menu.,I'm from San Jose, so it's almost unfair for me to rate this boba. But I'm gonna do it anyway. 

Boba in San Jose/Cupertino is a-plenty. Literally, there's a boba shop on every frickin' corner. And it's my lifeline. Loves it!

So when I told the Boyfriend that I was disappointed in Phoenix's lack of boba, he ruffed up his feathers and said, Let's go to Chandler!

He brought me here on the recommendation of his friends and I happily ordered the Jasmine milk tea with boba.

Actually, I was pleasantly surprised. While this totally doesn't compare to San Jose/Cupertino boba, it holds its own. It has the distinct milk tea flavors and the boba was a nice chewy consistency. 

I'd go again, if I had a boba craving in Phoenix. And the Boyfriend was willing to drive me to Chandler.,Eh we've had better. Way better. Place looked liked a prepubescent teenagers bedroom - messy and dirty. Drinks barely had any ice. Over priced for what it was. Won't be back.,Love love love. My favorite is the raspberry black tea boba. My friends rave about the popcorn chicken.,2 stars for the stupid kids who work here. I'm pretty desperate for boba when i'm in Arizona since I don't have the luxury of having a boba place in every freakin corner like i do back home....... so i might will be back, but i'll make sure to make my order crystal clear to the kids who work here.

So I went in a couple weeks ago, and this girl working the register is totally staring into space as i'm ordering. Now it's like a million degrees outside so I'm definitely craving something cool and refreshing, nothing milky. I tell this girl... ""I want two jasmine green teas"". I made sure to make myself clear.... i did NOT say jasmine MILK tea, i said jasmine green tea since this has happened to me at this location before.

When my drinks are done, the teenage boy yells ""2 jasmine milk teas"". OMG. Did i not make myself clear??? SO i explain to this boy, i wanted jasmine green teas, i didn't order a milk tea. And he gives me the craziest look and says "" sooooooo you just want green tea?"" So i repeated myself and he says "" soooooo you don't want milk?"" YES CHILD, THAT'S WHAT I SAID! Do you not make that here? Omg I never had an issue ordering a jasmine green tea back home with workers who could barely speak english!!! I was so annoyed.

I took my teas since i had already created so much confusion behind the counter. Ugh, i must find another boba place in this state!,I enjoy a cup of Boba every now and then.  Back in college it was an up and coming hot thing.  So Starbucks vs. Boba was a daily debate.  Boba Tea House - wow what an original name!  Yeahhhhh...... As usual my boba selection was off the charts?  Why so much flavor man?  I only and always get the Thai Tea with Boba....might as well call it ""Bo's"" Ba ... :)  Service was easy going and I get my tea the way I want it.  However, what's up with the A/C?  They have fans blowing left and right?  Does making Boba take that much power that you have to switch off the A/C? or does the salt water tank with the fish need to be at a certain temp?  They have a leather couch, but no thanks I like the skin on my legs where they are.  Not sure what's up, but I bet all their workers can't wait till the winter season - enjoy!,This is my comfort drink. You could cut this cut this little gem out of Chandler and pluck it anywhere in SF or San Jose and it would hold its own against any other boba place there! 

They have the traditional flavors like almond, and more ""exotic"" options such as lychee. Slushees teas and juices...they have a fairly good selection of concoctions. No, it's not as extensive as shops in Oakland's Chinatown, but hell, this is *Chandler* and A LOT better than I'd expected to find nine months ago! 

Now...the true test of a boba house - the quality of its tapioca! Some places have pearls that are too mushy, some don't cook em quite long enough and end up soft on the outside but too firm on the inside, leaving you a tooth-sticking mess while chewing (try not to smile during). 

Boba Tea House has near-perfect pearls. Not too soft (you can still use them as missiles should you choose as they do not stick to the straw), not too hard (your jaw won't ache). 

As the pearls are my favorite part of boba teas, this fact alone earns them five stars in my book! The first time I went here I'd lived in Gilbert for about 3 months. I was a bit depressed because school is all-consuming, and I was really homesick for SF food. I wasn't expecting much. After popping the plastic cap with my over-sized straw and taking that oh-so-satisfying first suck 'n' chew, my eyes teared and I knew I'd eventually find my gastronomic place here.

All hail Boba Tea House!,This place is one of my favorites it is so good! I would love to drink boba tea every day if I could. There is only one location I know about  and it is kind of far from me but I am glad they are still in business every time I go they seem busy.
I love the taro-almond milk slush. The big black tapioca balls are the best but so is the royal milk slush and the lychee. It's hard to choose my favorite since everything they have is so good. It's so nice that they seal it up for you too so you can take some home and refrigerate a drink for later.  
The people working here are always nice and helpful. I would recommend this place to anyone. :),My go-to place for boba...until today. This was the second time they didn't add boba after I asked for it (which I though was the default choice). I'll be looking for someplace closer to home from now on.,Eh. I've had better. Their boba was.....how do I explain? ....it was like, falling apart. They weren't that firm, the texture was just gross (and yes, I've had boba before....) Also, there wasn't a lot of ice in my drink, which also made it more gross. 

I think I will stick with my regular place....I like the boba at a restaurant in Mekong Plaza....I think it's called Taiwan Food Express...but I'm not sure.. It's on the North side of the Plaza and it faces the parking lot. There's a bunch of pictures of Boba Tea, ya can't miss it. (but I think I am going to give The Street a try....thanks Arlington W.),Boba Tea House, why are you so far away from me!!!??!

This is the only boba place in Arizona I've had that actually comes close to good boba. I've had so much of the overpriced, watered down powdered crap that I was ready to pack up and move back to California! Seriously, we have boba in socal on every corner, some better than others, but people here are deprived!

Until one day my roommate took a trip down to chandler and brought me back awesomeness in a cup. Since then I have made several trips of my own with the excuse of visiting friends to come to this place lol. Yes they use powder but they use a blender to mix it with the tea and milk so its a little thicker in consistency, just short of creamy, mmmmm. Quality is noticeably better!

My favorites are the honey green milk tea and coconut milk tea. Have also tried the black milk tea, boba milk tea, peach black tea, taro milk tea, and almond milk tea and they were all good. 

Just wish it was closer to Glendale :(,Their boba drinks are good.  The Thai iced tea is good too.

The snacks they serve there are actually better than the drinks. 

Your order always comes out in a timely manner, even when it's busy.

My only complaint is that not everything on the wall menu is available..  They need to update it, because I'm one of those people that are into the items that they no longer serve.,Best boba I've had in Arizona hands down. You know of a better place? Let me know and I'll put it to the test. Honestly. It's that good. I've never had a problem with their boba being frozen or too hard. Their milk tea tastes legit! I haven't actually checked though to see if they actually use real tea with real condensed milk instead of that powdery stuff some places try to pull on you.. Their selection of finger foods is just enough to keep you going but not so much it takes away from it being a small tea house atmosphere. A honest good quick boba place that I make sure to hit whenever I'm in this part of town.,Boba tea is my favorite addiction, and this is by far my favorite place in AZ to get it. I travel from downtown Phoenix regularly just to get my fix, and on my way I pass several other options that don't even compare. 

There are a lot of great flavors to choose from at The Boba Tea House, but I would suggest the standard ""boba tea with boba"". Don't be freaked out by the tapioca at the bottom. It's sort of an acquired taste, but once you get into it, it's a beautiful and obsession.,Good choice for bubble tea if you are looking for a cool beverage after shopping at nearby Lee Lee Market.  The milk teas are refreshing and have a good selection to choose from.  My taro almond milk tea was not too sweet, which is a big plus since it's very easy to over-sugar the drink.  The selection of jellies and tapioca is not as wide as the menu states, because they didn't carry the almond jellies I requested that were on the menu.  Instead, they have mini tapioca, regular tapioca, lychee jelly, green (apple?) jelly, and mixed rainbow jelly.  They also have some snack foods available to go with your drink, which I'd like to try out next time I'm there.

Oh and the aquarium there is really nice.  Lots of happy saltwater fishies!,Ohhh boba, how I crave thee like a ho' craves crack. 

I have been on a boba kick lately and even more since I have discovered is the various gels/jellies that are also available to mix into these wonderful drinks and smoothies. 
On this trip I decided on a Thai Tea slush with regular boba (they also have micro-boba) and Peach Snow (more of a smoothy) with mixed jellies (they come in various flavors). 
The thai tea was from a mix that had non-dairy creamer instead of milk but it was tasty and the boba cooked to perfection. The Peach Snow that I had saved for later was very tasty, and the mixed jellies were fun and chewy, but not as chewy as the boba, which I also like. Reminds me a lot of pieces of nata de coco (Philippine specialty that is cut into bite sized cubes and I love to eat straight out of the package/jar with chopsticks). 

This will be a regular stop when I find myself in the area or after shopping at Lee Lee.,I feel in love with this little place!

Good variety of menu food (calamari, chicken, poppers, etc.) and drinks (snow, slush, milk tea). +1

Minimum of $5 if you use a credit card. -1

Boba balls come in flavors AS WELL +1

There is usually parking, and it's right next to an awesome asian market +1

Internet access (I'm not sure if it's just for customers or not..yet) +1

Clean and good working furniture, employees that are bilingual (not that I need that, but it's nice to have) +1

=4 stars

Will be back more often, you can count on it!,This place rocks! I go to a lot of boba places around the valley and this one is one of my favorites! What gets my 5 stars is the CHEAP PRICE and the MANY FLAVOR SELECTIONS TO CHOOSE FROM! A nice little area to wait while your drinks are being made. Flat screen TV, music and friendly staff. Also, this place doesn't just sell you boba drinks... but they offer small plated food as well and it's pretty good for the price too! A must stop after grocery shopping at Lee Lee Market in that same plaza. My usual flavor of boba tea: taro with boba & lychee bits, or just the honeydew with boba too, of course!,The price was actually pretty good here. My girlfriend and I live in Flagstaff and we both have been craving boba for so long. We were happy because when we walked in, we saw a bunch of asian kids hanging out in there and we thought that we may have hit the jackpot. Thats how you know a boba place is good, when there are a bunch of asian teens just hanging out haha

I liked my green honey milk tea a lot. Its what I am use to drinking in San Jose and I thought it was right on. My girlfriend got a passion fruit drink, I have definitely have had better. Her drink was just waay to sweet and got unbearable to the point where she didn't even finish it. I felt bad because it was a disappointment to her after going so long without boba. 

I personally would come back here just for the milk tea, and maybe try some of their popcorn chicken, love those!

I wish Arizona had a Tap x,yeaa buddie milk tea with grass jelly ftw!,Okay, I have only had boba in two places... here and at Republic Ramen but this place was far superior.

The boba is soft and the perfect texture.  The smoothies are yummy!  I liked every flavor I tried except the rainbow one... to sugary.. more for a little kid.  The almond milk tea was also really good.

This is now my new addiction.  Wish I had found this place years ago.,Sometimes when I'm craving a boba tea... I stop by the Boba Tea House by Lee Lee grocery. Unlike other places that sell boba this is the place to be because of its large selection! Upon walking in to the establishment, you realize how it has this contemporary modern feel to it with the flat screen tv and couches. To the left are three large menu boards with more than 50 boba tea drinks, slushes, smoothies, and hot teas. Interesting menu items such as the volcano, sunrise and so forth, and staple flavors like taro, pineapple, strawberry, then they have durian, and lychee. Apart from boba drinks they also have snack items like fries, calamari, wings, potstickers etc. Prices are cheap and the overall product is good. So, if you have a hankering for some boba and are in the Lee Lee complex, stop by, coz it's worth it!,oh how i love this place let me count the ways.
to start off i must mention this is no where near as good as my tapioca express and quickly back in the bay area that is for damn sure.
yes i do happen to love this place for their almond milk tea, lavendar milk tea, coconut taro, and coconut almond, oh and of course the thai milk tea. yummmmmmy!  being limited to boba place really sucks so this is the best in the east valley that i have been too and i think ive been to every location in the east valley that has boba.  thank god for their punch cards. im just waiting for the day til the accept credit cards under $5. i always have to buy two but when im hungry i dont need that much to fill me up. :),I used to swear by lollicup, and would only come here only if I really had to (or I was by LeeLee's and was too lazy to drive a mile), but I think they might've gotten better. The last time I went was during summer when it was scorching hot and they were trying to save money on a/c--ridiculous. This time, I went with a bunch of friends after dim sum and the boba was good and the milk tea was not too sweet, just right.,I like that they have a huge variety of drinks. So many that I never can decide and end up in a panic and ordering the same thing every time. The red bean slush is so good and they put a scoop of the red bean on top. I don't get the boba in it since it is a slush and it makes the boba hard if you dont drink it fast. 

This is my favorite spot to go to when on this side of town. I'll even skip the boba at Lee's when im getting my sandwich for this place.,This is a nice place for boba teas. There are tons of different flavors available and you can also get just regular green and black tea. Most flavored tea places don't have unflavored/unsugared tea, so it is nice to have the option. I also tasted the plum green tea, which had a unique and interesting sweetness. In addition, this place has a selection of fried foods and snacks, including fish balls, but I have not tried them.,I love you boba tea house! After living in Arizona for the past year I have definitely been deprived of a quality cup of boba tea.. This place is very similar to tea houses that I frequent back home in the Bay Area and it definitely put a smile on my face.. I ordered a cup of black tea (sweetened) with tapioca pearls for $2.82.. While the price is a little higher than what I normally pay it was worth it because Tucson lacks an establishment that sells a proper cup of this stuff.. The pearls were alright but I prefer them to taste a bit sweeter (like honey), and the tea wasn't anything special.. It kinda tasted like a variation of McDonalds sweet tea.. It wasn't bad but it wasn't as good as the black tea that I get back home.. My friend ordered the lavendar milk tea and while I was hesitant to try it, it turned out to be very tasty! I am the type of person to stick with what I know is good so I rarely stray from my usual order.. I'm glad that my friend is more willing to try different flavors because it allowed me to opportunity to discover that I love the lavendar milk tea! Next time I'm in the area I will think about switching up my routine [:,I was really hoping they would have sesame milk, but I didn't see it on the menu so I ordered a boba milk tea today before shopping at Lee Lee. It was good, but there wasn't much boba. I tried the popcorn chicken on a past visit and it was OK. I ordered it extra spicy and it was mild at best. Also, it didn't have enough fried basil and the chicken wasn't crispy enough. 

A huge star deducted for lack of AC or not having it on high enough.They had a large fan blowing, but it wasn't enough for the middle of an Arizona summer.,I love this place and my 2yr old daughter loves it evem more~ I've tried the slushy drinks to the teas and really like them all. Their boba is always cooked well and atmosphere is great, although it is sometimes a little warm in there (feel bad for the girls that work there!). The snacks are quite good too. If it's on the way to where we're going, we never pass it by!,I'm a Huuuge Boba fan.  This place serves up the best in AZ.  The atmosphere is a bit obnoxious but I never plan on enjoying my tea in house.  The service is quick and always gets my order right.,I stopped in here for work purposed and went ahead and tried and Boba Tea.  I had never had one before but I was pleasantly surprised.  I don't know what flavor I had because I asked for whatever was good.  This is a cool little spot with bright colors and friendly staff.  I would defiantly stop by here again if I am in the area :),Did not like the Boba here. It was too mushy, my iced almond milk tea was warm even with the ice. The tofu snack was bland and the sauce was ketchup and sweet. The tofu snack was also very soft. The blueberry snow also sucked, according to my fiance. The best thing about this place was that it was cheaper than any boba place I've been to in California.,I love the boba here. It's the perfect texture. My favorite is the avocado.,Can't say anything about the snacks here as I haven't eaten anything here. All I get here is the mocha boba slush. And boy, is it delicious! It's become a Saturday/ Sunday ritual for me to go to Lee Lee's and then stop here for mocha. I do agree with some of the other reviewers about the counter people, though. They're not quite there. If they paid a little more attention to customers when they were placing orders and managed to look a little more interested in what they do, it would be awesome! I also agree that the place is LOUD. What with the TV, screaming kids and the RRRRR of the grinder crushing ice....I'm better off slurping my boba in my car. They do have a bunch of magazines at a bar like counter right at the entrance. So if you have a pair of noise-cancelling earphones, you're pretty much good to go. Good location though....right near Lee's (heavenly) sandwiches and Lee  Lee's groceries. A slice of heaven for an Asian expat!,Purfect! That's all I can say!,I still love this place.

Big fish tank, free internet kiosk, a couch, and of course a wide boba selection.

I am a food adventure and I like odd flavors, however I met my match. The red bean milk tea was just too odd for me. It tasted like one mixed ice cream with old bowl of chili beans. The texture was just off, and just thinking about it brings back a weak stomach.

Go for a any thing you think would be in a drink milk juice, like strawberry or coffee and it will be good. 

Don't forget to get boba in it otherwise why did you even come? The soft squishy tapioca bads ad a fun texture contract to a drink. They are a bit softer than gummy bears and have no real flavor.,drinks are super cheap here but it's only great depending on who makes it. If you don't like it, they will redo it for you. I suggest you get their teas because their boba is kinda chewy and rubbery.  They have a loyalty card. If you buy 9 drinks, you get one free. remember to have them stamp that shiz. 

Don't ever come here on Wednesdays! Parking's a biottchhh. If you can make it past Lee Lee's supermarket without being crushed by asian drivers,be prepared for what's next. 
this is AZ's ABB central. Beware those asian boys with their cars. they will stare you down and steal all the parking spaces available :)
  
As to the atmosphere, its clean and very well groomed.  

overall, ok.,I've seen this place for a long time and even it is almost around the corner today I've tried it. Good variety!!! many options and a good price. I had a lavender milk tea with boba and it was GOOD!

The place has a nice decoration and service is good. The only thing against? the boba at The Street tastes better (For me at least). But that won't stop me having some flowerlicius teas!!,Excellent Boba's! I always get the Taro flavor wherever I go, and this place makes it the best! Perfectly blended with great boba. The staff is young, but very friendly and the service is always quick. Sucks that its far away from me now that I moved to PHX, but nonetheless, when I'm stocking up on Asian groceries from Lee Lee's, I always make sure to stop in. Especially during the summer. So refreshing!,I use to ALWAYS go here with my friends, yeah it use to be our meet up spot so we can head out during the night..But now it's lacking on drinks. The drinks are already pre-made. I usually get the Taro tea with boba, ITS PRE-MADE which means, my, well what suppose to be ICE is melted and watered down, ICK! and the boba just is not as chewy, its all soft and with melt in your mouth deal. I'm disappointed of how it's become. But Since I am by LeeLee's its the only boba option I can grab in a quick hurry, but my money has not been spent on here lately.,This place is ok. The girls behind the counter are about as friendly as an iceberg...they don't ever smile! 

Boba drinks are ok and prices are reasonable. It will satisfy your craving for the time being. I always get the Passion Fruit Slush with Boba.

Seems to be a hang out place for young Asians.,Yummy Boba tea, great slush drinks, and cute servers. What's not to love? 

Well, it can get a little expensive for a college student, but prices are comparable to Starbucks ;) Go get some Boba!,Whatever you do, DO NOT under any circumstances try BOBA TEA.  You will instantly become addicted and then end up craving it like a pregnant lady craves mud and pickles.  Pregnant ladies are weird.  
For the uninitiated,  Boba Tea is various types of teas, slushes or milk drinks that you can have them put these little tapioca balls into.  They are about the size of a pea and they taste kinda sweet and are chewy.  They serve two purposes as far as I can tell.  To shoot up your straw at light speed and cause you to foolishly choke in front of your hot lady date or to turn the boring ho-hum activity of drinking into a fun filled game of hide and go seek with your straw.  
Now I usually get one of two drinks, the Black Honey Tea with boba or the Ginger Milk drink with boba as well.  Both are awesome in their own respect.  The Black tea is very light and thirst quenching and the Ginger Milk is creamy, sweet with the throat burning effects only ginger can give.  
My only complaint, and this is solely directed at my own inability to jam that straw through the top of the cup.  I am instantly transported back to the days of youth soccer wherein I was the only kid too stupid to jam that straw through the top of a caprisun.  At least this time I don't share my shame with a bunch of jocks but instead get snickered at by the Asians as I jam that silly large straw through the top and splash tea all over my school clothes.,Love me some Boba Tea House. The girls working here are always nice and full of energy and the selection of teas is incredible. I always get the Almond Milk Tea with Boba and it's a great rush of sugar if you don't feel like downing a stomach sized cup of Starbucks to get your rush. 

It's not that expensive compared to a lot of Boba places around town, and the taste is great.,Ordered myself a milk tea with boba. It was decent, you can't really go wrong with milk tea because it's a staple in a boba shop. I didn't like how it was pre-made though. Of all the boba shops that I've been to and myself, having worked at a boba shop, this is the first pre-made drink that I have ever got and the shop wasn't even busy! I rather have my drink made to order instead of pre-made. Who knows how long it's been sitting there? I just don't know how I feel about that. 

Since there's not a lot of decent boba shops around, I'd probably come back to see what else they have to offer. Hopefully, I will have a better experience.,I live right down the road from this place and never have been in before until today. 

My first experience with BOBA was in San Francisco in 2002.  Ill admit that the first time i tried it i was really taken aback. Well fast forward to today, me and a coworker were having lunch at lee's sandwiches across the street and i told her about this place.  Me with my very lame description, She had no idea what i was talking about.  I forgot what the BOBA balls were made of. 

Well today after lunch i said we should go over to the Boba Tea House and give it a whirl.  We ordered a iced coffee and BOBA, only thing that was kinda annoying was having to pay cash. They do not accept cards if it is under 5 bucks.  But i can get over that.  

Now to the description, and ill be honest i really enjoyed the iced coffee the drink was made pretty decently, this is no sour tasting coffee.  The drink it reminded me of 2003 all over again, seeing my surprised coworkers face after drinking her first drink of BOBA.  After a long discussion about how weird it was, but a fun drink. I think we will be back again in the near future . I know i will be with my wife and daughter!

this would be a fun place if your just hanging out and want a cold drink, especially here in the desert.  Or if you are on a date or in high school.,Good as it gets! We all know arizona aint know socal! But this boba establishment is really yummy! and the works are always friendly,typical boba place. Drinks are a little sweeter here than other places i have been.

I do normally rank boba places at a 2 because the whole culture that follows it annoys me.

I give 1 more star because...well to be honest the music wasn't blaring and was good enough to have a decent conversation friendly ambiance inside.,I'm hooked. After google searching and then seeing the Yelp rating, I decided to stop by Boba Tea House this weekend.

The couchs are comfortable, the TVs were tuned to something decent to watch while we waited for our order and the staff was pleasant.

I ordered the Green Apple Tea and my friend had some type of fruit slush boba. Both were delicious and had perfect density boba (not too chewy, not too soft). We did not try the food, but I may go back and give it a go after reading more details about the previous reviews.

Make note that there is a $5 minimum if you plan to use your debit card and that a regular size (there are two sizes) boba is not $5+.,They do have the check in offer where you get one free add-in (boba, jelly, etc.) so that is quite nice. The price is not bad, too. The guy that works at the counter, he is a very sweet and nice guy and they do it right after you place the order so the speed is quite fast, that is if you are the only one in line :D Overall, boba here is okay; however, not something I would go crazy for. Kinda too far from my house; but once in awhile, when I do go to Lee Lee's, I will stop by there. :D,all i can say is... its hard to mess up a Boba shop :)  this place is really good, they have so many selections and also some small dishes like fish balls (YUM), french fries and lots of other finger foods.  also if u like import cars, just show up there before closing and you'll see all the fast and the furious wanna be's park their ride in front of the place.,Yay! I'm a fan. It's just unfortunate that Boba Tea House is a good 30 minutes away from me. Otherwise, I'd be that fan that stops by every single day. Well, until I get a boba place near me in the North Phoenix/Scottsdale (hint hint) then I just have to settle for visiting Boba Tea House once a month or so when I hit up LeeLee's for a grocery stock up trip. Oh, and you best believe that I stock up on my boba too. Yes, that's me carrying a tray of 4 milk teas so I have one for the ride home and a couple for later. What can I say, I really like milk teas.

At Boba Tea House, in particular, I'm a fan of their lavender milk tea - it is deelish! I also get the coconut milk tea or lychee milk tea if the mood strikes me. The hubby sticks with his favorite thai milk tea which is strong...just the way he likes it.

Like most boba places, you can get regular boba, mini boba or an assortment of jellies. I typically forgo the boba entirely and stick with coconut or lychee jellies. They add a burst of sweetness and have a texture that I prefer over boba. 

Already looking forward to my next venture out to this area so I can treat myself to more milk teas and I'll just continue waiting for one to pop up in this area...,In love with their fried calamari's,My first taste of boba was at an Asian market out in the West Valley.  Since that time I've found a few places closer to me that offer boba.  Boba Tea House is my favorite.

They offer a wide variety of flavors and most can be mixed.  I don't venture into paths unknown with my drinks and always grab a lychee snow with boba.  

I've been impressed with each visit.  The only draw back is that I don't feel comfortable hanging out there.  If you're over 18 you will most likely be the oldest person in the joint.  Typically I drop by for a boba after shopping at the market next door and bail when my drink is ready.  I imagine it makes a good hangout place for a younger crowd.

The crowd won't deter me.  I will continue going to Boba Tea House for all my boba needs.,Hmm, this place is hit and miss.  The first time or two that I went to Boba Tea House I was pretty pleased with it but... guess I was getting lucky.  I've noticed in my last visits that sometimes, the boba is soggy and the tea weak.  One time, I blamed it on the late hour but I don't go late very often.  I started asking for 'light ice' in my tea because you never know if it's going to be weak or not but, after this last trip, I think I'll just find another place to get my boba fix. I really can't stand mushy smushy tapioca pearls! 

It's too bad since it's close to my house and a nice place to sit and visit with a friend.  I like the aquarium and couches that they have...

Prolly won't see ya there.,Not a big fan of the Boba Tea House by Lee Lee. I like their decor, very hip. However, their milk tea mix was not that great. It felt like basic sugared water. I've had better ones over in Lollicup or Quickly in LA. It's a pretty busy location as it is next to Lee Lee's, but unfortunately they definitely aren't quite there yet with the competition.,This place is way better than The Street. The boba texture is closer to what I prefer and my almond milk tea was exceptionally creamy, something I've never had before in all the teahouses I tried in SF/LA/NYC. I have no idea why The Street gets better reviews, especially considering they are more expensive!,I love their boba tea.  I get the black milk tea with large boba.  Almost all the time, the boba are fresh.  A lot of these places mess up the boba, and when it's messed up it's nastyy!  They have lots of weird and different flavors, but I always get the same thing...I'm boring, I guess :)

Black Cat Coffee House,"This place has everything needed to be a hit.  The espresso is delicious, the sandwiches are homemade, yummy and reasonably priced, the staff is friendly and the environment comfortable.  It's also open until 10 which is nice for those of us who find ourselves tied to desks until 5 or 6.  And bonus - I was visited by one of the owners who sincerely asked if everything was as good as it could be.  Nice touch.

Their web site and social media presence seems to need some help but as they've only been open for 5 months it's understandable.  I'll be going back.,Glad to see a nice, friendly coffee shop open in Arcadia. Their big, open front doors are especially nice for sipping a coffee in the early morning during the Fall.

They use locally roasted coffee (Passport) and locally baked pastries. A nice selection of teas as well, including Thai iced tea, which I don't often see on coffee shop menus.

Staff is very friendly, but they are still learning and there are some consistency issues. I like cappuccinos and no two people there seem to make them the same way. But their official Grand Opening isn't until Halloween, and it always takes new places a while to work out the kinks. Hoping for great things!,Excellent french press coffee and the nicest service.,I really enjoy this place...their iced coffee with cream is wonderful!!  Their coffee is AMAZING!! The taste is like no other...it almost has this sweet quality to it.  They have huge cups that are great because I like to have biggest iced coffee possible!  They have a a great thai iced tea as well...you do not see that often at many places.  The people behind counter are so nice and friendly.  The first time I went there I spoke to the guy behind the counter for like 20 minutes.  He was awesome!  I wish it were on my way to work, but it definitely has become my weekend spot.  I go here about once a week!,I have to add that this place is so chill and mellow and never too crowded. I get SO much work done when I come here and jump on the lap top without a loud crowd to distract me. Sundays here may become a weekly ritual!,what a plesant suprise .. great new clean coffee house, FINALLY a selection of "" Sugar Free"" coffee drinks ! and they use local blends ,   fresh local pastry . and the Owners are awesome and there to greet you !  I'm a fan now... not another "" over priced"" coffee house, just right !     welcome to Our Arcadia neighborhood,Great new coffee house in Arcadia.  Nice selection of offerings.  My Vanilla latte was delicious.  Thanks for offering low-fat products.  Saw some other patrons having some baked goods.  They looked appetizing. Service was great and the atmosphere was fun and inviting.

Can't wait to go back.,Best Chai Tea Latte around in my eyes.  A little sweeter then the norm but really hits the spot.,Ok love this little, local coffee house.  Prices include tax & very are reasonable.  Try the iced chai latte!  They support local charities.,By far my favorite place to hang out, read a book, have a muffin & a latte. Aside from peak hours it's pretty quiet - lots of people on their laptops working or lounging and reading the paper. 

Black Cat is truly a local gem. I adore most local spots but this is a nice break from the hipster snobs/atmosphere. It is simply homey. The perfect lil' hideout.,Awesome place to relax and enjoy good food and a large variety of beverages. The people here are super friendly and the service is awesome!!! I've only been here a few times and they already know my name and my drink. This kick ass coffee shop has a very friendly family like atmosphere.,I like this place. I don't frequent the locally owned coffee shops as much as I used to but I will for sure return to this one. The one downfall is they serve Passport coffee but my iced americano was better than I expected. I think they can do better than Passport and for that, Black Cat really deserves 4.5 stars. However, this place doesn't have the pretentiousness you find at Echo or Lux (ugh Lux) and that's what I like. I am comfortable when I walk in and the baristas are friendly. I also thought the prices were fair and they surprisingly have a good selection of pastries, desserts and even in-house sandwiches. They also have smoothies and blended drinks which is why I will be dropping by a lot in the summer. So if you want good coffee without (or a smoothie) ""the scene"", then the Black Cat is your place.,Arcadia needed this coffee house!  Hava Java married Coffee Bean!  First, let me admit that I drink a lot of coffee, specifically flavored lattes.  Daily, sometimes more than once a day, I will visit Starbucks, LGO, Hava Java, or Carmel's.  Black Cat is similar to Hava Java: large patio doors that open up during cooler weather, inviting interior with artwork, music playing, and cute baristas.  Black Cat has more seating than the closest Starbucks at 44th and Hava Java.  It's way quieter than LGO or Starbucks.  It has able wall outlets vs Hava Java.  It has two leather chairs!  Which, if they put 2 or 3 more sets (or leather love seats) where some of the bistro tables are, would make me rate this SIX STARS.  I give it four stars because it recently opened and this business could go to 5 or 3 over the next 6 to 9 months.  If they pull this Hava Java meets Coffee Bean off, it will compete with the best of them.  Yay!  I'm a fan.,I've stopped by three times. The first time I had French press flavored cover. Brew was well timed and very tasty. I had a muffin that was fresh and moist. 

The second time I ordered a latte and croissant. The latte was done well. The croissant, while it had a good bread taste, was not the layer buttery taste I was looking for. (Recommended Essence Bakery in Tempe as an alternate source.)

Third visit was perfect. Cappuccino and Biscotti. Coffee roaster is locally sourced from Passport in Scottsdale. Biscotti is from Bad Boy Biscotti in Gilbert. 

Service was very friendly. The same person made my coffee drinks each time, and the quality was consistent. The atmosphere is delightful with the open doors or outside tables and background music that doesn't over power conversation. 

I'm giving five stars. I've been very pleased on each visit and I'm glad they've joined the Arcadia neighborhood.,Dear Black Cat,

Can you pretty, pretty please move to my neighborhood? Or make another location in Scottsdale? I'd just love it. Thanks!

Boyfriend and I happened upon Black Cat a few months ago. We were starving and on our way to a fun- and monkey-filled day at the zoo and tried to stop in at Over Easy. The line was out the door and we were reaching hangry levels. On a whim (like I'm sure a lot of people), we decided to try out luck next door at this cute little coffee house.

HELLO, BREAKFAST SANDWICHES.

Huge, fluffy eggs. Buttery croissants. Thick cut tomatoes. Assorted meats for him. Tasty, gooey cheese for both. Add a huge, slightly chocolatey iced coffee for each of us and it was love at first sight.

We've returned twice since then, the latest being this morning. We just love this place. All employees we've talked to are so nice (the first time we got a punch card, and they gave us double punches. Weeee!) and both food and drink product is so, so stellar. We don't live very close but when we are in the area, Black Cat is IT!,YUM! Great local coffee house! My soy latte and breakfast sandwich were both delish. Only con is cost, but all coffee houses seem expensive to me and this one runs about average so I will stick with the 5 stars on taste.  Can't wait to be a regular on weekends!,First,  let me disclose, I'm not a coffee drinker. (But tea drinkers - I got you, no worries!)  But, don't let that stop you from reading my review or disregard my awesome rating of Black Cat Coffee House.  I have my reasons, I promise!   Read on... 

I LOVE this place!   After 8 years of graduate school visiting many, many coffee shops throughout Tempe, Scottsdale and Phoenix - this is THE place I've been searching for all my life!  (or at least my academic life!)    Free internet makes for a productive work day and with Over Easy next door, there's great people watching for the casual coffee-goer too! 

So, why does a non-coffee drinking coffee-shop hopping academic have to say about this place?  So many things!  where to begin?  

The tea choices...ahh, the tea choices!!!  It's as though I found the end of the rainbow - tea lovers rejoice, b/c this is the place to go for our ""pot o' gold"" (in the form of many, many delicious flavors of tea.)   My favorite:  Cactus Blossom.  I like it iced.  Get it. And I highly recommend you just go ahead and get the medium or large, because I suspect you'll love it as much as I do!   So many other delicious choices - even for people who aren't hardcore tea-drinkers - you'll even find something you love here!!!   Maybe the kiwi-strawberry iced tea as a cool alternative for the summer months?  or Passionfruit.    They also have many more traditional and non-traditional tea flavors.  So many choices, what to do??!?    Also  - my friends who are crazy coffee-aholics like to the coffee here, so while I cannot personally validate it, I would tend to believe them. 

Second reason I love this place: the lighting!   As anyone who spends much time in coffee shops may have realized, often coffee shops are dark.  I like sunshine.  I do live in Phoenix, after all!   There are tables outside and inside, the doors fold wide open and plenty of light gets in, so even if you are slaving away over a paper or dissertation, you'll still soak up some Vitamin D and feel like you are in the land of the living. 

Third reason:  I haven't eaten there yet, but I'm super impressed with food options.  Here's what I've discovered in my coffee shop days - the food is either uber healthy, made for the granola-earth biscuits out there who just rode their bicycle 60 miles in the 115 degree sun to stop in and pick up a green tea, 3 carrot sticks and a vegan cracker for dessert.  (nothing wrong with that, just not everyone's thing)  OR on the other hand, it's a giant double-sized triple chocolate cheesecake, massive bearclaw with a side of donut holes, and a caramel-chocolate-raspberry muffin, which has the caloric equivalent of 6 Big Macs ""super sized"".  So - if you want something more than a seaweed cracker, but don't want to gain 15 lbs from a muffin, this place gets it done.   You can choose from a variety of healthy food options, hot or cold breakfast/lunch items, and if you do feel like splurging - they do have some tasty pastries of normal portion sizes to try too! 

Last - the staff are all friendly and welcoming.  The owner or manager (not sure) has personally stopped by each time I've been there to say hi and check in on how things are.   The place is immaculately clean and the music is mellow and relaxing. The hours are excellent.   

Oh - and tax is included, so the price you see is what you pay.  That's a pretty cool difference from most places!   And drinks are affordable!!  

So, stop by - I'll be the one basking in the sunshine in the corner -  just don't take my spot!   =),A great cafe.  A welcome surprise to find in Phoenix.

Local, good coffee, friendly service, good ambience, free wifi.  That's what I'm looking for in a cafe when I'm hitting the computer.  I was glad to meet and chat with Don, the owner, both times I visited.

The prices are a little higher than that chain coffee place that shan't be mentioned, but if that's enough to keep you away, this place ain't for you anyway.

I'll definitely be back,Favorite coffee shop in Phoenix right here. Where do I begin with my love for this place? Their iced toddy is mind-blowing. No coffee has ever jump started my day the way this stuff does. It is smooth, delicious and full of caffeination.

This place gets major brownie points for having almond milk. Thank God I don't have to ever have another latte with dairy or soy. Their iced chai with almond milk will change your life and it makes their toddy that much smoother.

Their food is delectable. They have Tammie Coe everything and if you haven't tried Tammie Coe cakes, you're missing out. I haven't tried a cupcake, muffin or breakfast sandwich I didn't like (make sure you try a breakfast croissant sandwich with turkey bacon. Earth shattering good.)

Last but definitely not least, their customer service is epic. I have the best convos with these guys and they're always ready to suggest good teas to match my mood or go above and beyond to make my drink perfect. They're like my neighborhood friends. What more could you ask for from a place? The owners of BCCH have done everything right!,Great service, clean quiet atmosphere and not corporate.,I think I have a new favorite coffee shop.  

Black Cat serves one of the best lattes I've ever had.  The peaberry french press was perfectly roasted and perfectly timed.  Great cookies, awesome biscotti.  Modern, relaxing, comfortable decor.  Super friendly service.  Love it!,I love this coffee shop. I haven't tried the food yet but I can vouch for the coffee, the ambiance, and the music selection. If the food is decent, they'll definitely get a star upgrade.,This place is a little more pricey than most, which is fine if the product was exceptional, but I was not impressed. To me, the coffee tasted watered down. I did like the ambiance and there were no problems with the service.,Wow -- I've found another great local coffee house! Being a grad student, coffee houses are my second home, and I much prefer the locally-owned type. 

I found this place by accident one day on my way back to PHX from Scottsdale, along Indian School Rd. The name intrigued me and it was fairly hot outside, and a cold beverage was in order. The guy whipped up a perfectly blended mocha with coconut for me - YUM!  

The interior is long and narrow, and kinda dark (which is fine with me, just mentioning it). The tables along the wall are the bistro/pub set type, which I really like. A sofa and a couple comfy-looking chairs are towards the front, along with 3-4 regular-height tables with four chairs each. 

Black Cat has a frequent visitor program, so be sure to pick up a card at the register -- buy 9, get the 10th free. There's a little outside seating, and they have free Wi-Fi. Also, their prices up on the board already include AZ and PHX tax...I wish everyone in town did that. 

Compared to other local coffee houses like Urban Beans that has a full-on breakfast/brunch/lunch menu, they have a couple of salad options and a few sandwiches. The baked treats in the counter look delectable. I'll definitely be a regular here!,There's a cool cat in town and it's known as Black Cat Coffee House. All they need is some live jazz playing and they'll be set. I wouldn't have expected a cool coffee shop like this to be living in the Safeway shopping center, but it's a great fit! This coffee shop isn't big, but there's enough room to sit and do some work if you want. The menu is a good size for the coffee shop. They offer pastries, a hefty selection of coffee (including a tasty sounding Iced Toffee Mocha!), freshly made loose leaf hot or iced teas and even a couple meal options like a hefty salad or sandwich. I will definitely be back to try more items on their menu, but during my first visit, I enjoyed a refreshing (and quite large) iced tea. It was naturally sweetened and they have about 12+ flavors to choose from. I opted for a berry flavor which I liked. This is definitely a great spot to relax, work or have a meeting!",0.300541
