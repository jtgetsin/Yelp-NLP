The people are nice and helpful with recommending different coffees based on your taste preferences. I found this place when I was still a student at ASU and it was a great go-to spot if you want to hang out/study with some friends later in the night. I've met people up here and I got to do exactly what I wanted to do: drink coffee and catch up with friends until the wee hours (conversations can run long-especially whne girls get to talking).,ZW8jy6ehrNzn9A5iCubVGg

I mostly go for the fantastic night barristas, the large patio area and the folks that hang out there in this post Jamaican Blue era. 
I strongly suggest this place to a) support local endeavors, b) hang out with friends, or c) do some homework.  Don't come just for the coffee.",YnUOjXIzNebruPbKhCEIHQ

This place is definitely packed with local students, some getting there as soon as it opens to get one of the coveted 4-seater tables with outlets. There's still room in ""The Vault"" though if all of the main tables are taken. 

The staff is pretty friendly once you get to know them, there tends to be live music from time to time (usually have a schedule up on the main counter) and the music piped in over the PA system can range from classic rock, to reggae, to psy trance, to Japanese ""J-Rock"". 

Plenty of seating for smokers in a sheltered outside area. Bathrooms are separate from the main area, across the smoker's ""hallway"" and are usually pretty clean, which is nice. Some wear is evident in the place. Some of the carpet is lose and can be a tripping hazard if they don't have it taped down, some of the chairs and tables in the smoking area are starting to break down a bit, but all in all I like it here and I keep coming back.",YLIq7yD6OoEimMFisNxBMg
Food; Coffee & Tea,IoFggnoj1P4EcmNEP2K6Ng,Xtreme Bean Coffee Company,122,3.5,3.5,4,"Alrighty, if you've been down to ""The Bean"" anytime in the last year, you've more than likely seen my mug around there. It has slowly become my home away from home, so I feel fairly competent in giving a well rounded opinion. 

First off, as has been said by others, one of The Bean's best qualities is the fact that it is open 24 hours on the weekends (Friday 5 am - Sunday 11 pm). This works out wonderfully for us 21+ who don't want the night to end after the bar's throw us out to the streets. Basically, its a ""you can't stay here, but you can go to The Bean"" kind of situation. For the rest of the week, it is open from 5 am till 11 pm, giving us night owls a place to hang around. 

Now I can get a bit into the drink and food. If you're coming to The Bean, you know the coffee is alright. It's certainly not the best cup you will get in AZ, but they do roast their own beans on premises a few times a week (ensuring a pretty fresh cup of joe). You can tell the roasting days by the smoke coming off the chimney, and the acrid, dizzying, and often intoxicating scent, suffocating the area. If the coffee is to your liking, you can purchase it to bring home, whole or pre-ground. Offering your standard array of drip, french press, espresso, latte's, cappuccinos, etc..., all available served hot or cold,  Xtreme Bean has your coffee fix, well, fixed.

For those of you not coffee inclined, the Bean offer's a large array of loose leaf teas, which you can mix and match to make your own creation (May I be allowed to recommend a Black Currant/Moroccan Mint blend, on ice?). Green teas, decaf, black, the have it all. Also offered: creme blended drinks, italian sodas in a plethora of flavors, Naked Juice.

Food wise, they keep it pretty simple at the The Bean. Made fresh every 2 days, they have salads, sandwich's, and pita wraps, as well as a grand assortment of pastries (if you get there before noon, after which the pastries are usually gone) The wraps are alright, sandwich's are ok. It's all edible, and priced a bit higher then what its worth. Bagels, muffins, doughnuts, cookies, slices of cake, and usually some sort of banana bread all grace the food cooler. 

Moving on to seating, its pretty sacred reality if you get there during peak hours. With plenty of electrical sockets inside, in the floors and in the walls, The Bean is highly lap top friendly. The Internet connection is free, but it can border on agonizingly slow when there are numerous people using it. The aptly named Vault (The Bean IS located in what at one point was a bank) is generally known to be the quiet study section. Outside, there are your standard tables and chairs, most of which are falling apart, or wobbly, or bent. During the nights it can be difficult to impossible to find a spot, especially once it gets nice out. If you aren't a fan of smokers, then you may want to sit inside as nearly the entire patio is smoker friendly (even if the ashtrays mysteriously disappear every few months). 

Every few nights, they have some sort of live music being played. Monday nights is given over to the piano and classic show tunes crowd, who, as you guessed, sing show tunes and take turns playing the piano. Loudly, might I add. Loudly, and incessantly, and they take over the majority of the seats inside. If you need to get work done on a Monday, move into the Vault (where its kind of quieter) or go outside. Friday nights are a rotation of performers, usually a single guitarist with an amp. These performers usually add more ambiance than annoyance to the atmosphere, so even if you are going to the shop to sit and talk with people, you can do just that without getting drowned out by the musicians. Be sure to request Freebird, one day someone will actually play it. 

I'm beginning to think I've rambled enough for now, but I'm fairly certain you've gotten a decent picture. Good for the people, the socialization, the place to go on weekends after, literally, everything else in Tempe has closed. If you're ever down to The Bean, feel free to say hello if you see me on the patio!",yHkl3rzkOIoTU7M_9DMS5g

Don't get me wrong, I love hanging out here and have been doing so for a while. It's a unique spot and has a kind of awkward-but-homey feel, like it's housed in a building it's not really supposed to be in. The vibe is upbeat and friendly for the most part and it's kind of cool to hang out in a VAULT. But the two-star rating comes from the most important reason why I'm here, yo: the coffee.

I have never once had HOT coffee here. I like my coffee searing hot. Like lava. But I always get flaccid, limp, lukewarm beverages here. I even specified ""extra hot"" once and it still wasn't up to temp.

But the tea selection is really good. I like how the loose leaf is presented in a way that you can see the contents of what's in the tea blends. And the pastries always look very tempting.

And if we are meeting, why not take the opportunity to treat our staff at good quality local coffee shop too, just makes perfect sense to us.

When the 4 of us arrived, the general indoor seating area had a few large tables (large enough for 4 people) that were taken by single persons. So we resorted to having our meeting in the ""vault"" which has an open table large enough for us. This was our first time here and did not know whether the ""vault"" area was a quiet area or not, but we tried to discuss work without being overly loud. An hour later, a fellow patron leaving the room told us that it was the ""quiet room"" and that we should not be in there. 

Not seeing a single ""quiet"" sign around, I decided to confirm with Xtreme Bean staff and their response was that they don't know why people have the impression that it is a quiet room. It is just another room, nothing special about it.

So I want to make sure my fellow patron knows, if you want to have a super quiet space to work at, maybe staying at home is a better option, or go to the library. Please don't tell fellow customers to leave, especially those who could not gain access to the large tables, because those were taken by other solo customers who love to spread out their belongings on a table large enough for a group of four.

We all love to support local businesses, so please make sure you know what the ""rules"" actually are before confronting other customers about your need for ""quietness."" If that is so important to you, please stay home.

Sorry if this sounds more like a rant than a review. But I just want other customers to know about my overall experience here was a good one. 

The staff was helpful and the drinks were decent, but us customers could do better to help support the business by being a little more considerate and not take up more space than we need to. 

If you take up a table large enough for four and others had no choice but leave because of that, you are indirectly taking the business away from the coffee shop. With more people there, they will sell more drinks and food. Of course, unless you plan to purchase enough food and drinks to cover the difference between one customer and four customers. I am just talking from a business owner's point of view, since I run a small business too.

Note to staff of Xtreme Beans, please let me know if I am wrong about the ""quiet room"" since I last talked with you. I will be happy to take my staff somewhere else if the large tables were taken by single users and we could not use the customer designated ""quiet room.""

Great selections of coffees, teas (loose leaf), bakery items, frozen/blended drinks and Italian soda's. We LOVE the Carmel Royales.

Located near Jo Anns fabric in what I refer to as a concrete island (meaning it is part of a strip mall, but not technically connected to said strip mall) with it's own mini-drive through, it is also across the street from Sunflower Market. 

At first it feels like a Starfucks rip-off, but the actually delicious looking pastries, cheap prices and staff with actual personalities changes that impression fast. A diverse crowd enjoys the brew here, all kinds of seating (esp. the rather weirdly inviting cubicle room for studying that reminds me of Real Genius for some reason...maybe it was the bearded guy in there), and plenty of outdoor seating.

My tasty bagel and decaf coffee with soy came out to under 4 bucks and was quite good.  With all the seating and good 'vibes' in this place, a great place for studying or procastinating on studying. 

You could bring your dirty hipster friend or your mom here-and that is a good thing.

NO TAXATION ON LACTOSE INTOLERATION

After a couple more times coming here, you know what?

Not impressed.

I don't like it. I can't eat anything, there is never any seating except in that creepy back room that is supposed to be a study area but always has people babbling away, and I am sick of the dirty hipster punks smoking their anarchy, corporate-sponsored lungs outside.

Final straw? I had an entirely unreasonable fight with a barista regarding soy! WTF? I ordered just a regular decaf coffee, and politely asked if they kept soy on the kiosk (you know the one with sugar and milk stuff), and she said they keep it in the fridge. I asked her if I could have some. I notice my total is wrong and go over the order again. Where did the extra 50 cents come in? ""Oh that is for soy."" ""Um, that is like a THIMBLE size of soy. I am NOT paying 50 cents for that."" ""Well, that is the rule"" ""What rule? Wildflower, Three Roots and a bunch of other places don't charge me to use a little bit of soy"" ""It costs extra to get soy."" ""I can get a full container of soy MILK across the street at Sunflower for a little over a buck. Would you prefer I just got a container there for that amount and brought it back with me?"" ""Soy milk costs like, over 3 bucks.."" (This statement is accompanied with an eye roll). ""Look, I am vegan (a white lie) and extremely lactose intolerance. I can't have milk. They don't get charged for milk. I am not paying that amount. Can I just talk to your manager?"" ""We don't like have one right now"" (I swear to god she really talked like this) At this point, some laid back guy just said, ""Dude don't charge her."" I thanked him, saying I wasn't trying to be difficult, but paying that much was ridiculous, and he agreed since he was vegan himself. 

I called back several times and never got a call back regarding the soy incident.

I know I sound crazy, but GODDAMN, I am sick of the lactose intolerance tax! Soy is hip! Everybody drinks soy! And you can get it cheap!

Honestly, it's only because they've got the only game in town.  That's right, America's largest public university is served by exactly 1 coffeehouse that is open to midnight.  Cartel recently pushed their ridiculous 8pm close to 10pm.  But no one else does the late night thing except Xtreme Bean.

In fact, the extended hours and generous sizes are still all I can recommend.  As ASU has grown, XB gets more and more crowded.  Good luck finding a table any night after 9pm.  Plus, all the extra people also slow the wifi to a crawl.  

So why am I going?  It's coffee.  It's a place to study.  It's the only place open after 10.  

Note to entrepreneurs-- want to make some money?  Open a decent 24 hour coffeehouse a few blocks away from the nation's biggest university.

I remember when they were starting to try out their own beans a few years back.  The owner would roast a batch and the coffee was horrible for a while.  I would try to get the baristas to make my drink with some of the outsourced beans, if they had any left.  Since then they have gotten better at roasting, but it is still not great.

The coffee is okay at best, the prices are what you would expect from a coffee house, and they offer free WiFi - that's about all the good I can list.

The serious downside is the staff and the ambiance.  On my last visit to the Bean, I went with a friend who is a regular.  The girl at the cash register recognized him and chatted with him while completely ignoring me.  After 10 minutes of chatting laden with profanity, complaining about her employer, the sun, and screaming ""F***"" while continually asking her coworker at the drive-thru to give her sunglasses- she finally asked him what he wanted to drink.

She then ignored me again.  After literally taking out money and waiving it to her I ordered my drink and a bagel.  All I asked for was coffee with hazelnut added and a bagel with cream cheese.

She got my order wrong.  There was no hazelnut in my coffee, the coffee tasted burnt and old, and there was about a half pound of cream cheese on my questionably toasted (cold but crunchy) bagel.

I MIGHT have even been able to overlook many of the downfalls in service and quality (frankly I'll drink just about anything you call coffee and pour in a cup for me) if the atmosphere had at least been pleasant.  The staff is in charge of music and apparently often uses their personal play list as the music for the shop.  This would be fine if it wasn't being played at a concert level volume.

P.D. ran it like a hang out for friends, hosting all sorts of little parties for customers, and live music of various types over the years. When they'd see my car in the line, by the time I got up to the window my custom coffee drink would be ready.  I made friends with the baristas.   It was family.  Celebrated the fearful 2K midnight transition there -- P.D. brought cake, poppers, etc.

 I went there almost daily for 10 years, and heard the story about the young man who wanted to buy the business from him.  Wanted a ready-made drive-through.  P.D. refused --  this was his baby, his dream, his family.   So when that didn't work, that boy had his father buy the building, and refused to renew the lease for P.D. & the Gold Bar.  We wrote letters, New Times did a story, but that underhanded thief wanted to steal a business, rather than set up his own, and it all was in vain.

P.D. then sold his successful business, moved away,  and the Gold Bar opened across the street, across from Basha's.   If I want coffee in the neighborhood, I go there.

For one, free WiFi is awesome, even if theirs is slower than many dial-ups. Getting a good signal inside the vault is tough too. 

Two, the whole live music thing really works there. Mondays is ragtime night, Thursdays is usually acoustic and Fridays is a hodgepodge. 

Years ago they had small bands that set up in front of the piano, but all music booked there is strategically done so that it is not intrusive to people trying to work.

Ownership is aware that lots of college kids use that place as their library and many business people also get on their laptops at XB so the next local coming of Judas Priest isn't going to be setting up shop there anytime soon. 

The piano is also free game to any patron wanting to show off his/her stuff. I've yet to hear anyone embarrass there; The audience is too big and too busy to take that risk. 

Three, XB offers a wide assortment of teas. I am not a coffee drinker but I know a good tea when I taste one. Of XB's 500 or so tea flavors, I've found two that I like and about 5 that taste like Valvoline that half a pint of honey can't make more flavorful. 

Just the fact that they offer honey in a squeeze bottle over individual packets is a huge plus. Unsweetened iced teas (I've had 2/3) are also pretty good. 

I'm at XB quite often during closing time (it used to be open all night) and sometimes the girl will start cleaning the tables and say to me directly, ""It's 11 o'clock, we're closed."" It's as if she's telling me to go but the 13 other people chatting or working on laptops get to stay until 11:30. 

Now what they do is turn the Internet server off at 10:35 to get people to leave quicker. I think that's a little Bush League.

Yes I know the staff is eccentric, grungy and not super friendly but the prices are good and there is plenty of places to sit and chill, kind of like a coffee shop equivalent to a dive/neighborhood bar.  I've been going there at least once or twice a week for 5-6 years and they know exactly what coffee drink I need.  They have an excellent selection of teas, pastries and sandwiches.

Food; Coffee & Tea,IoFggnoj1P4EcmNEP2K6Ng,Xtreme Bean Coffee Company,122,3.5,3.59,1,"YUCK!
Just Yuck.

  They have a large selection of coffee drinks you can get on their menu, each one I've tried was more unappetizing than the last. 
  On my first visit I opted for an iced toddy, my poison of choice. I watched the girl in the drive-thru make my drink and I was a little perplexed about what the hell she was doing. I know some places use a concentrate, then add water to cut it. I watched her as she first added cream to the bottom of the cup, then added water, then added the tiniest portion of toddy ""concentrate"". What I ended up with was a large cup of watered down 1/2 & 1/2 with a slight watered down coffee taste. I don't get it. If you need to cut the toddy down, add the water and toddy concentrate first. I don't see how you can tell how light or dark the toddy is when you've already added cream to it. The main ingredient is coffee, which my cup barely had any of. When she handed me my cup, I asked the girl why she added the cream to the cup first and her response was just ""that's the way we do it"".  On this same visit, my boyfriend got an iced americano, which was just as disgusting as my toddy. He asked me to take a sip to see if it tasted the same to me. The espresso tasted like it had either been burned or sitting for a while before she added it to the water. We were both really upset as we were really jones-ing for caffeine. Neither of us took more than a couple of sips before deciding to throw our drinks away. To add insult to injury, I gave the girl a 100% tip before she was rude to me and made us 2 undrinkable beverages. Next time I'll hang on to the gratuity until I have an actual interaction with my drink and barista.
  On my second visit, I only came in because I had about an hour to kill while my car was at the Discount Tire in the same shopping complex. It was a hot day and I wanted something cold and refreshing. I went in and decided to skip the toddy (even though it's what I would have preferred to get) and decided to get an iced chai with a couple shots of espresso in it. I paid and waited a couple of mins for my drink. When my name was called I walked over to the little bar was she sat my drink down. It was 3/4 of the way full with barely any ice in it. What was this extra room for? I wasn't going to add creamer to my drink. A long line started to form and the barista got busy taking orders for other people. I sat there at the little window and waited for at least 5 mins trying to ask them for more ice. The barista kept walking by me, and ignored my presence. All I wanted was more ice. Finally another employee came up to me and asked ""what do you want?"" very rudely. ""more ice?"" i replied. She snatched the cup out of my hand and reluctantly went and got me more ice for my ICED drink. So rude. I left the building and decided to go wait at the tire shop instead. I don't think I've ever felt so unwelcome in a business. On my way out I took a sip of my drink. Ew. It was sooooo sweet. I added the couple of shots of espresso to try and cut down on how sweet the drink was sure to taste but it didn't work. I ended up throwing my drink out before I got back to the tire shop, a mere 1 min walk from Xtreme Bean's front door to the tire shops entrance. 

I get it. You've got cute girls working here. Cute girls and free wi-fi. That may be enough for the sea of young dudes that seem to flock to this establishment, but not for me. You don't have to go far in this town to find great coffee, or at least decent coffee with better service. They may have gotten another star from me if the employees had been the least bit more accommodating,  but after 2 strikes I don't want to return to see if they'd get a 3rd or not.",ESrdXpT1yF7KZX52bPpnJg

- Depending on who's working sometimes they play good Indie Jams!

-There's not very much room to sit inside and if you are going with more than 3 people you pretty much will not find a place to sit :(

He didn't see the cloud of fruit flies that rose up inside the case when they slid the door open in back to get his roll.

The Bean has GREAT brewed coffee.  They are fantastic with samples of whatever they have brewed, and I find there coffees very smooth. They are actually the only place where I sometimes ordered the day's flavored coffee; for some reason, their flavored actually tastes good to me with a little half and half, while most places taste like fake-flavored coffee, overdone on the additive flavor.

The baristas ALWAYS offer to make a fresh pot of flavored if it's past 11 and I'm interested in it. I think that's amazing... but I can't let them seemingly waste a whole new pot of it on me?  If I ever have to wait for a new pot to brew, they are always amazingly nice about it, no matter what location I go to.

I like the living room feel of this location, the couch, comfy chairs, and big ""conference"" type table. I also like sitting outside if it's not too hot; somehow I enjoy it out there, even though I'm looking at a parking lot & Chandler Blvd. Maybe the coffee is just that good to me...

I came here for an iced coffee the other day because it was nearby and ended up paying around $4 for a medium iced coffee with caramel sweetening. Really? $4? I know I wouldn't even pay that much for a large iced coffee at Starbucks! Maybe I was mis-charged? I don't know. All I know is I thought it was an outrageous price. I don't mind paying that much for a latte or blended beverage, but just plain iced coffee? Come on! The coffee itself was delicious, but was it worth $4? Eh I don't really know.

The service was okay, though the barista did seem confused when I asked if I could get a flavor in my iced coffee. It's like getting a flavored iced latte but with all coffee instead of milk - what's the big deal? Apparently it was confusing. But whatever. This confusion is probably what caused me to get over-charged.

I worked at this location for almost two years, and while I was miserable pretty much the entire time I still enjoy coming here for coffee. One of the reasons being, I love the location. Being a bit more off the beaten path, it caters to a more neighborhood-y crowd for being a chain. A lot more regulars and not as many tourists(except during Spring Training time which always made me especially suicidal when I was an employee). 
And the coffee is pretty decent. There aren't as many selections of flavors as Starbucks but I always thought the quality was better. I highly suggest trying the new Pecan Praline latte which is delicious, plus the blendeds are far superior due to them actually being BLENDED and not chunks of ice. 
The place closes at 7pm all week so it's not exactly a nighttime hangout. Of course when I worked there closing time was an annoying and unnecessary 9pm....it's nice the bastards finally get their act together AFTER I leave.

Steve's Espresso is tucked away on the side of an obscure strip mall in Tempe.  Most don't even know it is here, which is perfect for an increasingly anti-social nerd like myself.

The atmosphere is a little bit different, too.  While it is like most coffee shops, it is a bit simpler and the music is a bit different.  All of which add to my liking of this place.

Tucked into a corner of a strip mall (of course) of McClintock and Baseline, there was ample parking. There were some guys chilling out at the steel tables with umbrellas outside the cafe, smoking and reading books. Indoors, the rust orange colour was pretty soothing as were the wooden floors. Some small tables and chairs and lounging furniture scattered around the front of the cafe. Great artwork on the walls. The counter was inviting and had a lot of good looking, fresh pastries. The owners were there, chilling out and training a new barista and recommended the American iced decaf since they didn't have decaf iced coffee. It was delicious with soy and it cost under 2 bucks and it was a pretty big sized cup! I found this place to be one of the friendliest, cleanest coffee shops and I liked the magazine and newspaper selection.

It wasn't.  My espresso was bitter and a touch sour.  It was drinkable, but that's hardly a recommendation.  

I tried one of their breakfast pastries, with cheese, bacon, and egg.  I was even less impressed with that.  I was surprised when the cashier handed it to me and told me I should go microwave it myself in an oven they have by the door.  I was told to put it in for 45 seconds.  I figured they would know their business and trusted what I was told.  After I left I decided to sneak a bite while stopped at a light.  The thing was ice cold in the center.  Great.  A bacon, egg and cheese-icle.  Even the part around the edge that was warm wasn't that great.  The dough tasted like it came out of a tube.  I probably would have been better off with something else.  There were several baked goods in the case that looked amazing.

The person that helped me seemed really nice, so I kind of feel bad giving the place such a hard review.  Honestly, most people would probably be happy with the drinks here, especially if you're the sort that pumps a bunch of sugary crap into your drink. 

According to a sign on the door they specialize in French press coffee, so ordering that might be a better bet.  But if that's the case, why doesn't he call the place Steve's French Press Coffee?  Either way, I won't be risking another stop here.",j_9LVE3fqDx1lwYqkAIBEg

I love Steve's Espresso.  

Maybe there are fancier coffee shops out there.  I'm not going to say this is the best Coffee shop in the world.  But it *is* the best one I've been to in this area and I've tried quite a few.

The atmosphere is decent, though I always find it to be a little warmer and louder inside than I'd prefer, but that's just my opinion, it's not too bad at all.  

The service is always good - there is usually one of two guys working the espresso machine, and they are both great - super friendly, make good drinks and they make those good drinks fast.  

Free wi-fi here as well.  

I've been all over the menu to try most of the drinks they have.  I like my drinks strong, but not bitter or over-roasted...and Steve's never disappoints.  I've yet to have a bad experience here.  My wife, however, found one drink and will never stray - the Aztec Mocha -- it's delightful.  

The pastries are also pretty good too -- yes, they are made before you get there.  Yes, you warm them in the microwave.  But they are not half bad.  Sure there are fresher options in the world.  But these are decent for sure.  Personally, I get the breakfast brioche...a lot.  

The scones are excellent as well.  The orange/cranberry one in particular.

They also have a pretty good looking selection of loose leaf teas as well -- I'm not a big tea guy (except when I'm sick), so I haven't tried any of the teas...but I will some day.

I could go on and on.  But if you're in the Tempe area and need a coffee...skip Starbucks and gives Steve's a try.",4GBlFEDgO3BTiIVZCS_21w

I always end up going to Steve's when I need to get work done. They've got bigger tables and a generally more mature clientele. They also play some good music, which unlike Solo, is relaxing and easy to work to.

And not to mention the coffee... it's the best in town. They french press every cup, which I love. The refills are cheap, unlike Solo.

By the way, if you haven't ever had an almond milk mocha, get one here.  I was actually here this morning at 9:30am and they were out of almond milk, but I'm sure that was just a glitch in the matrix.

I also appreciate the seating they provide.  There's a good number of tables and chairs and couches inside, as well as a few tables out front.  It's the perfect spot for a quick meeting, a quiet place to catch up on emails, or just enjoy a cup of joe.",3TGup17SCV6uHsifmTKirg

To be fair I've never once had a good experience at any Starbucks, and this was no exception. To me, Starbucks is always crowded, noisy, and has slow and rude service. Overall too stressful for me, if I want coffee I want a relaxing experience.

On this trip, I ordered a breakfast sandwich, whichever one was featured in all the pictures on the menus. I asked for it to have turkey bacon instead of regular bacon. This totally confused the barista who for some reason thought I wanted two sandwiches. We got our stuff to go and getting outside was like a blessing as it was so much quieter outside.  I opened my package and found a completely different sandwich from what I ordered. My friends then explained that Starbucks doesn't customize sandwiches for customers and what I got was a sandwich called the turkey bacon. I have no clue why the barista couldn't have explained that to me instead of just giving me the wrong thing. there are no signs indicating this and as a non-regular I wouldn't have known. My friends couldn't explain it to me at the time of ordering because the store was so noisy and loud they would have had to scream at me. The sandwich I received was bland and I only ate a small part of it before throwing it out. The only other item I got was from the cold case, so they couldn't screw that up because I picked it myself.

Whatevs. It's coffee, and with their new not-burned-to-oblivion roast, it's better than it used to be. It's also on the way to work and a lot faster than stopping by Cartel. Plus, I can stop in when I take the bus to work, which I can't do with Cartel. 

That's where the comparison ends, though. No matter how you slice it, Starbucks' coffee is nothing to write home about - it's bland. It's boring. It's...well...Starbucksy. But the baristas are perky, welcoming and efficient. They even make a point to ask about my morning. 

Why they insist on asking how I spell my name, however, I will never, ever know.

With an h, without an h, who gives a good goddamn? Will it make the lattes taste like they were made by a person and not a robot? Otherwise, I really don't give a shit what you write on my paper cup. You can call me Ted Kaczynski for all I care. Let me just put up the hood on this sweatshirt and grab my drink and I will be on my way back to my cabin in Montana. 

I've also been tempted to tell them my name is something ridiculous. Like, ""It's Melanie, but with two ee's at the end and a circumflex on the a."" Just to see if they'd do it. Or ask what a circumflex is. 

But you know what, I'm tired of hating on Starbucks. Sure, it's an easy target: too big, too corporate, too friendly. Sure, there's a lot of crappola for sale along with my coffee. And yeah, the pre-packaged food is overpriced. But in the world of corporate behemoths, I could be dealing with a lot worse - in terms of employment practices, environmental practices, trade practices, you name it.

When I discovered this place near the beginning of my senior year, I went perhaps 3-4 times a month. The ambiance and friendly service from the baristas is enough to pick this place over Starbucks or some other chain, but no, this place goes the extra mile in every which way.

The coffee is brewed to order, with top shelf organic, fair trade ingredients. This means you're going to have to wait a bit for your drink (about 5 minutes, unless its busy, then maybe perhaps as much as 10 if only one guy is working the bar). So this place isn't if you want a quick cup of joe to go. But the coffee is well worth the wait. 

Coming from the DC area, I've been to my fair share of coffee houses, and this is by far and away the best coffee I've ever had. The baristas are experts at presenting the full flavor of whatever drink you order. Everything on the menu is worth a shot, and be sure to ask the barista on duty for their picks if you're feeling indecisive.

This is the perfect place to come after class and order a large (or two) and work on school work. The clientele is mostly college folk and other assorted hipster types, so if you're into the local art or music scenes, you can come down here and make a few friends.

When I first arrived here I was greeted by a very friendly barista who was happy to discuss the drink options with a first-timer. I settled on a mocha and it was delicious! I like that it wasn't scorching hot - so I could enjoy it right away instead of having to sit and stare at it for 5 minutes. 

Also I really like the atmosphere here. The place is pretty small (I like this in a coffee shop - at least until I get here and there's no where to sit). It's also pretty quiet, which makes it a good place to sit and study. My favorite part is that I have been here for a while now and don't feel obligated to leave like some places. 

The -1 star is because the chair I'm sitting isn't very comfortable (hahah) but they do have couches, which is probably a better alternative. Also, they don't have a very wide selection of pastries/food. This is always a bummer when I go to a place to study.

After checking out the great reviews on here, I decided to skip on my usuals (XB, Steve's)  and come here.  (No negatives or neutrals this time!)

+ Great location.  Strip mall, not too much traffic.  The storefront faces Baseline, so you can sit in comfort and watch cars go by.

+ The atmosphere is amazing!  I walked in and automatically felt at home.  There are couches, benches, tables, outside seating.  Everything you want in a coffee shop.  There's beautiful photography on the walls (which you can buy), including one of Jared Leto (or at least it looks just like him).  And there are plenty of places to plug in your laptop.

+ Local coffee!! I love it when local shops use homegrown stuff.  I had never had this kind of espresso, but all I can say is that it's damn good.  I can't remember the name, though.

+ The drinks.  Oh. My. Word.  I ordered a cafe mocha with no whip.  It was smooth, creamy, and had just the right amount of mocha.  It was to die for.  Also, if you're a big foam fan, you'll love any of their hot drinks.  I had about an inch of foam in my cup and it was thick and flavorful.

+ The service is just as great as the coffee.  The guy at the counter was polite, helped me choose a good drink, and smiled.

Plus, it's right next to the hair salon I frequent (Altered Ego - it's great). However, there were several factors that made me bring down a five-star review (for the coffee) to a three. 

First, I do want to emphasize that the drink I got was absolutely divine. I ordered a caffe latte with almond milk and sugar-free vanilla syrup, and it came out really well.

The problem, however, was that I was getting the drink to go and it took at least 10 minutes for them to make it. I'm seriously not sure what the barista was doing (two people were behind the counter chatting). I was kind of in a hurry and was expecting it not to take very long to steam some milk, press the coffee, and put some syrup in. I tried to banter a little with the barista and she was having none of it. (Apparently she was tired and caffeine wasn't doing it.) Please, if the CUSTOMER is making the effort to put YOU in a good mood, try to let it happen

The other thing was that while the cafe was totally full, everybody was totally silent. As H.C. said, the place was full of zombie hipsters. It was really creepy. As I walked by various tables, people stared at me like I was interrupting their very important business. 

In conclusion, if you want to work on your computer in total silence and thus don't mind a) the long wait or b) the fact that everyone else is also totally silent, you will fit right in. I definitely loved my drink, but I don't know if I will be able to withstand the death stares for long enough to order.",ORw3ZwZHLGeTHx-cORSFNw

Mr. Mustachio lives around the corner from this weird little outdoor mall/office building complex that is meant to be a homey homage to main street.  But the reality feels more like the off season at a Disney attraction, complete with roadies with cans of tall bud lights and camels and bored office dudes cyborging it up with bluetooths. 

US Eggs, yummy burritos, pizza places, temp agencies (guess why I am here chugging coffee in the middle of a workday), booze and various other offices call this place home. I actually thought the store front was part of Altered Egos salon. When I entered, I was almost delirious with a 20 minute walk without shade with copious amounts of breast sweat. I had to get coffee and cool off before heading to the temps. 

This place was a really nice surprise- the others described the place really well, but classy is how I would put it-but kind of gay goth classy? Plus leather chairs, pews, short round tables, red velvet couches with dark wooden floors, big plants, tiffany style lamps, classic bike hanging over the bar, bookshelves crammed with books suspiciously resembling those from the free cart at Changing Hands, and a cute little Wii, this place is nice for the desert man. 

My barista was cool, and he made me a decaf iced americano that was pretty damn tasty and didn't charge for soy milk (it was on the counter) and gave me iced tap water free of charge. I wanted to eat, but truthfully the offerings were bare. I love larabars, but I can't pay twice as what is charged in supermarkets and the pastries were pretty bland and unappealing and saw no other food to buy-and I was trying!

I had to look to plug in my laptop-plenty at the pews, but I went to Catholic school and don't wish to put more time into having a numb ass (take that as you will) and ended up near the door.

There's a bench against the wall with tables and single chairs perpendicular. Another couple of tables are on the other side of the room for slightly larger groups. The bottom of the bench offers lots of outlets for working, and there is free wifi, although it requires a code from the staff.
The coffee was terrible, but I wasn't looking for gold exactly. It was served in a glass, which is nice (I hate when they serve ""for here"" drinks in the disposable mugs). They were also playing what sounded like a Styx' greatest hits CD overhead but, after I asked about it (I honestly was not complaining, just curious), switched it out to some cheese pop. It was also butt-ass hot in there. Sure, it's November, but it still gets warm in Phoenix. How about a swamp cooler?
What ticked me off about the place was that they don't give discounted refills: you have to pay full price for another cup. I haven't seen many places do that and, if they do, I don't go there again. $3.50 for two cups of bad coffee is a little much.
Nice atmosphere though, and it's a nice strip mall with a popular burrito place next door.",intz_M3Q3Toe0pwoN0zdzw

Entering the cafe, I knew that this was a place that I will have to return. I ordered an espresso and a Cafe au lait, both were excellent. The espresso sweet and creamy and the cafe au lait perfect to relax with.

There were a few people there, working, and the owner was chatting and putting away books. A very nice guy it seems.

The decor of the shop is also well done, from the bicycle hanging from the wall to the post-modern lamp arching across the Victorian sofa. Lots of plugs for your laptop and fast wi-fi.

They have a record player with headphones and an LP collection so you can just zone out to the music if you'd like. They also have a DVD collection and a medium sized flat screen to watch a movie on, if you'd so like. I glanced at the collection, and seeing Steve Zissou, decided it was quite adequate.

So I stopped in, thinking, ""meh, someone else opened a coffee shop.  Whatever.  Let's see if I can camp out and get a little work done.""  But as I walked in, I found that this place already has a decent following -- several happy customers sitting around.  And then, the owner/manager(?) saw me as he was working on something for another customer.  And this is when I became truly impressed with this place. 

He said hello, and then followed that he'd be able to take my order in about a minute.  And he did.  I ordered just a regular coffee, light/medium roast, which is my typical order at a coffee shop.  His response was something along the lines of, ""Great, I'll get that for you in just a few minutes.  We should probably brew a new pot.""  And then the kicker -- he noticed my leather satchel and inquired whether I'd been here before.  I said no, and he followed with a warm welcome and advice on how to get electricity and wifi for my computer.  Truly an all-around warm experience.  It's amazing what a little bit of good customer service can do to make the customer happy.

But that isn't all.  This establishment only uses locally sourced coffees and teas, and they take pride in the quality.

Also important, the decor and ambience are great at this place, as is the music selection, the library of books, the seating arrangement, and the overall concept.

1. It is not a fast, in-and-out place. Most of the time there appears to be only one person working. You often have to wait several minutes for your drink. I am usually not in a hurry, so no big deal, but if I was in a hurry Solo would not be a place I would stop.

The cafe au lait was great! It really reminded me of the french areas of Miami that I miss dearly. The proportion of coffee to steamed milk, and then the array of options to sweeten your drink, was perfect. I was able to make it my own, and was 110% pleased.

Unfortunately, what I *really* wanted to find was a local tea shop, and I'm not sure this place is it. I ordered a tea latte that was... lackluster. I'm not sure if it was just the blend I chose, or the balance of milk to tea to sweetener, but it just tasted off. The blueberry muffin had good flavor but was so incredibly dry and overwhelmingly huge I wasn't able to finish it either. Overall, my second visit was disappointing.

I was most surprised by the environment. From other reviews I read it was swanky, cool, relaxing, hip... and while I can see that it should be like that, both times I've visited it's been dead quiet despite there being a relatively large crowd there. Which, I suppose is good for those who need a good study or work place, but I almost felt like I was intruding, barging in to place an order, and talking on the phone while waiting.

I first stumbled across Solo due to it being connected to Altered Ego Salon & Spa, where i was able to order a tasty beverage from my salon chair. The first mocha was heaven and we have been inseparable ever since. 

One of my favorite elements of Solo is the atmosphere. It has a feel that is truly all its own. While the furniture and initial look may seem like the typical eclectic coffeehouse, I assure you it is so much more. The cafe has unique and comfortable furniture, games to play, books to read, and free wifi. The lighting is just perfect so that anyone can feel comfortable working yet also take a break and be instantaneously relaxed.

Equally important is their amazing menu and fabulous coffee skills. I can never get enough of the cherry danish and an iced peppermint cream, which is a tea-based beverage. I can also say that they have the best mocha I've had in the Phoenix area to date.

They have good coffee. Really good coffee. So good that the owner/barista actually asked me how the coffee was before I left. Imagine that! A barista that cares about his pour.

The internet is free and fast (the latter might be because it is still pretty unknown... I haven't been in there and seen more than two other customers) and there are plenty of places to plug-in.

The place has a comfortable feel to it... an eclectic mix of ikea bookshelves, modern photography, vintage records and lamps, and antique furniture pieces.

One somewhat odd thing: liquid sugar. Out of a little dispenser. I ended up drizzling it down the side of my mug. Maybe its more eco-friendly than sugar packets? I dunno.

My only gripe: as of early April 2008, they are only open until 9pm, making it an unreasonable destination for a late night of studying or socializing. They say this is going to change.

They seem to be rolling things out slowly. They do accept credit cards (though a previous review indicated that they don't).",6QjQOjPYmuTm-mrtsXYIAg

Nobody bothers you if you want to hole up in the church pew bench against the wall and work, or you can chat about music or philosophy on the couch amongst the hundreds of eclectic books on the shelf. 

The owners and employees are friendly without being intrusive, the coffee is impresive in quality and preparation. They use local people to roast their coffee...big plus in my book. 

The place is green using real dishes instead of defaulting to paper products, they use organic ingredients whenever they can, and there is free wifi.

Over time, my good friends have also understood this fact about my personality and have hunted down various coffee shops in the valley in efforts to save themselves and the rest of the population from my general obnoxiousness.  I must have been bothering one of my friends couple of weeks ago because she introduced me to Solo Café by stating flatly in a text: ""You need coffee.  Come to Solo Café.""

So, my relationship with Solo Café began, and I can honestly say that I have spent more time in Solo than I have with some people I have dated in the past.  I have produced my best work for my summer classes there because its calm vibe and the interesting artwork keeps me content, and the numerous outlets available throughout the Café feeds my pet - a.k.a. the laptop - as well.

As for the drinks, I can comment on their Americanos since that is the only thing I order at any coffee shop.  Solo Café's Americano is on the strong side, but it goes down smoothly without any milk.  Also, my insides have never screamed in pain after drinking a large cup of their Americano, so that is a positive sign.  My friend is more interesting than I am, so she orders different types of tea from time to time which all have had favorable reviews from her.  She tried the blue raspberry tea once, and it reminded me of a flavor from a packet of Skittles.  If you are not into the bitterness as I am, I'm sure you will find your niche in the variety of drinks Solo has to offer.   The baristas are always willing to assist in your decision making and to make you feel welcomed, so don't hesitate to ask for an opinion.",4GgRyG2HZCyNLZV--x0D6Q

The place is pretty cute inside, I really like their couch and fancy chairs, the rest of the furniture looks like it came from Ikea, but whatever, Ikea is cool. We went up and ordered a couple of lattes, a chocolate croissant, and a cranberry scone. Healthy. ha. So we waited a bit and then the barista called us up to get our drinks. It was so weird cuz the hot lattes come in glass cups... like beer cups. I found it strange... but I guess that doesn't matter. The lattes were good, not as good as my go to (cartel) but still good. The pastries were also yummy. The croissant was delicious and the scone was just ok, but quite large, I couldn't finish it. So this place is definitely a winner on the tour in comparison to some of the places I've been to which have been nothing exciting.

Anyway, off I went to Sola for a little slice of humanity and a couple of cups of extraordinary coffee!

Sola is a lovely little spot to spend an hour or two, sitting at one of the big tables, enjoying the conversations around you, the soft music playing, the hissing of the espresso machine as the delightful owners make the various coffee and tea concoctions...and a really extraordinary cup of coffee!

At Sola, they always grind the beans fresh when I ask for a cup...then they put a single cup filter (with the perfect amount of fresh ground beans) on top of the cup...then they pour perfectly heated water into the single cup filter and let it percolate into the cup for a perfect cup of coffee...that's right...I said ""perfect""!

I know, there are cappuccino and espresso and latte enthusiasts out there saying ""Donald, you just described a mere cup of coffee...it's not the caramel macchiato with whipped cream ambrosia that I usually drink!""

Well, I hear you...and I would be willing to bet that those kinds of coffee drinks are also excellent at Sola...but...I like my regular cup of coffee and I enjoy my cup of coffee at Sola more than any other single cup of coffee that I can recall...esp. given that I pay Sola about what I would pay for a large cup of crappy coffee from Charbucks:)

The coffee at Sola is never sitting in an urn...never on the heat...never not perfectly fresh and well made (I know...double negative...but artistic license wins out over correct grammar:)

Add in the fact that the people working at Sola are so nice, pay so much attention to detail in making my coffee and that they have created such a nice spot to relax, work and enjoy my coffee...well, I will submit that it is worth your time to swing through Old Town and discover Sola:)

If you see me at Sola, you are welcome to ""rub shoulders"" with me but please don't ""press my flesh""...I bruise easily these days:)",du6KeE54IFbPiXpU3LOd1g

Dude, I wasn't going to be able to drink the whole thing anyway, so what do I care?  They charged me a whopping $1.50 for it.

Sola, doesn't meet all my specs, but comes on close.  

The ambiance is great.  It's industrial in nature.  While it is located in a pretty touristy area, it still has the hole in the wall feel.  I'm not sure if they rotate their art installments.  I hope so because the current pieces are on par with my 9th grade notebook doodles.  Not sure what the kids behind the counter were spinning off the MacBook, but it was good...current, hip, indie, mellow, easy to Yelp to!

I ordered a non fat latte which I thoroughly enjoyed.  It was better than the Bucks or the Bean.  The rest of the menu looked good.  If I had been to the gym this morning I may have tried something a little sweeter or one of the treats from under the glass domes on the counter.

The guys behind the counter were great.  They were friendly and funny, but not over the top cheerful which can be annoying in the morning.  They are both really attentive to the customers and take care of business while having fun at the same time!  I can tell these guys enjoy their job and working with each other.  Ive been pretty amused listening to them talk about music.  If I were 17 again, I would probably want to work here with kids like these.  They have good attitudes that transcend the over all feel of the venue.  (it's funny that they have no idea I'm writing about them right now!)

As for comfort....total bust!!!!  F-.  This place is all hard surface.  Forget sinking in with a good book or an hour of surfing the inter web.

I didn't give it the fifth star, because while the milk is always perfectly creamy, it's often not hot, and I know I might get shot for this, Cartel is not my favorite coffee.  Also, there is one woman who charges double or triple for drinks from what most of the guys charge.

Pros:
-Not Starbucks
-Great location in Old Town Scottsdale and surrounded by lots of fun shopping/browsing
-Great atmosphere/interior

And thats about it. Now for the negatives.

Cons:
-The service was mediocre at best. When I have to greet the person helping me first, I internally come a little undone. 
-Yes there is a lot of seating, but it is overly awkward. I don't feel like cuddling with strangers on a couch while i'm trying to enjoy my coffee or stare deeply into some random persons eyes from a cross a long table where we are both trying to use our laptops.
- The coffee wasn't anything to rave over and after mediocre/almost shitty service, the coffee better rock my pants off.

In my experience, there is nothing about this place that would bring me back. A barista with zero customer service skills with an attitude that screams ""because we are a trendy coffee shop in Scottsdale I don't need to go out of my way to be kind to you"". Well, sir, yes you do.

We all agreed Starbucks was out of the question, so I suggested we try Sola, since I had heard good things about it and haven't been very impressed by any of the other coffee bars in Old Town.

The interior is minimalist, but I appreciate that.  I don't really want my coffee bar to be loaded with kitch and merchandise for sale.  Sola had a little bit of art on the walls, comfortable places to sit (could be more, though), and good, quiet music playing on the record player - yes, record player!!

Royal has knocked it out of the park on several occasions, both in quality of my drink and in quality of service.

1st visit- I ordered just a plain ol' cup of coffee. Each cup is brewed to order. No gross 2 hour old coffee sitting in a pot on a warming plate here. It was good coffee, rich and nutty. My daughter got a hot chocolate, which she enjoyed thoroughly. 
2nd visit- My daughter and I came in on a Wednesday night while getting dinner at the food trucks. The line was REALLY long. The barista seemed to keep her cool and even though people were kind of just standing about waiting to order their coffee (make a line, people!), she kept a good eye on who came in and when and knew exactly who to serve next.
My latte was good, and the milk was steamed well. The barista was very sweet and had a really good attitude. My only criticism of this visit was that my daughters drink wasn't really hot. It was actually a little on the cold side. My daughter is 10, but likes her hot chocolate HOT.

I go in here once a week. 9 times out of 10 I am greeted promptly and my coffee has been made with little to no mistakes. I don't think it's worth a trip from somewhere far away, there are great coffee houses all over the valley, but if you're downtown I would go in and order a drink.

I live in the neighborhood and have lots of choices for coffee within a short walk. Royal is becoming my favorite because of quality of coffee, ambiance, and service. 

The coffee roasted on premise is always a plus to me. The depth and nuance of the coffee flavors is always a enjoyable regardless of the technique used to make the coffee. 

The space is small and seemingly ever changing with additions (and deletions) of seating, tables shelves and art. At first glance the space seems small and dark but In its own way the space feels comfortable. It is difficult to describe.   

Royal is staffed with helpful perky people who seem to offer a smile or nice word regardless of how busy it is. Royal can be slow if it is busy but the patrons are interesting to speak to and the place has a unhurried vibe. If you stop by in the afternoon or evening it is especially pleasant.

Royal on the other hand is very quiet and serene (it shares the entrance to Red Door Spa so I guess it kind of has to be serene-who wants to me shoved out of the way by an overzealous scenester while waiting for a coffee before their massage?)

Anyway, the decor is open and airy, modern minimalist-it reminds me of a coffee joint you'd hit up in Zurich (or maybe somewhere in Germany).

Sure, they are just opening, so there's some kinks. Today they didn't have a ton of syrup selections, including my favorite almond rocca. However, they're getting them all in very soon! AND they offer almond milk - how awesome! They've got three benches inside too. Although it's pretty small, and awkwardly has an elevator leading up to the Red Door spa, I think it's a pretty cool space.

Glad to have the free wifi, some fresh squeezed OJ, and a tasty delicious coffee.

I am giving it 4 stars, however, for a couple reasons: 

1) they don't make their coffee in glass cups for stay-in orders, and all of their silverware is single-use plastic. I get that businesses do these things for convenience, but I KNOW you have a sink in the back. It's the 21st century and I think it's time we get with the program and cut back on the single-use disposables when they aren't really necessary.

2) I was disappointed with my yogurt parfait. Listen, I get it. This is a coffee shop. MY first mistake was expecting the parfait to be as good as the coffee. It came in a plastic cup with Yoplait yogurt and the granola was a crushed up Nature Valley bar, or something very similar. For the price of over $4, I would really have liked some REAL yogurt and REAL granola without all the HFCS/sugar. A girl can dream, can't she? 

I will know to order something different next time. 

I couldn't help but laugh at some previous comments regarding the ""douchebag"" location. I grew up in this area, so I feel your pain. The a-holes in their Lamborghinis, spoiled children, and plastic robot women are aspects of my going-out experience I would love to do without.

I don't want to see people dressed in clothes that cost more than my car while enjoying a good cup of coffee, and goddamn they serve good coffee.  I've had so much bad coffee in the valley in my first two months here, at places that call themselves coffee shops with ""baristas"" who dump foam onto my cappuccino as if they were a lunchlady unloading a particularly glutinous scoop of mashed potatoes onto my tray.  No thanks.

This place is like heaven.  A Chemex pour-over with my favorite Ethiopian coffee?  Oh yes.  I usually have to cover up Phoenix coffee with a thirty second pour of sugar and a half-gallon of cream, but not here.  I drank it black and relished every smooth drop.  The crazy-ass 18-hour iced coffee on the wall?  Pretentious and awesome.  Love it.

Okay, back to the location.  Why, oh why did you put your shop here?  Were there too many shops in cool locations and you decided that a-holes in Lamborghinis needed better coffee than me?  (I'm not exaggerating about a-holes in Lamborghinis, since one of them couldn't stop looking at my wife's boobs the entire time we ate at True Food).  

I want you to reconsider your poor choice of locations, with my full forgiveness, and open a shop in my garage.  I won't even charge you rent, just a Chemex pour-over every morning.  At the very least open a shop somewhere in central Phoenix.  I'll work for free.

They have excellent coffee - my ""go-to"" is an iced mocha with skim milk. IMO, the coffee is strong! But delicious. 

Better than the coffee are the breakfast sandwiches and burritos - I love that you add a sauce/spread to the sandwich - pesto, sundried tomato, etc . It really adds a nice element that you don't find elsewhere. Additionally, the baked goods: cookies, breads, and muffins, are all yummy, but also calorie-ful. 

Pricing is a little high but not extreme - really it is consistent with the location being in North Scottsdale.

The restaurant has nice seating inside and outside and offers free wifi (the password is ""greatcoffee"". I think they recently swapped out the soft chairs and couches for regular tables/chairs instead. 

Oh! And they have a frequent guest program... no cards/punches, they just take your name each time you get a coffee and you eventually earn a free one. Make sure to mention it each time, as I have had a few that were missed because I didn't bring it up to the cashier.

Service is normally nice - they get quite busy and sometimes it feels a bit rushed, but never rude.

Food; Coffee & Tea,3OF6i6LTzRXpwNgodv7aeQ,Press Coffee Roasters,71,4.5,3.52,5,"Came here last Friday after getting into the Phoenix area for Spring Training.  After trying the first time, we came back both Saturday and Sunday morning as well.

The cafe isn't large, but it has a cool mix of modern style with antique touches.  They're rocking some serious coffee and espresso tech - Synesso espresso machine and Bunn Trifecta.  The Synesso is the newer version with some automated pressure profiling, and the Trifecta is new single cup brewer with many controllable variables (Water temp, volume, mixing, etc.) similar in purpose to a Clover, but probably functionally a cross between an aeropress and a siphon.  Probably not for french-press lovers, but great for clarity. Needless to say, you only get these things for your cafe if you really care about coffee and quality.

Coffees tried (and preparation):

Twitch Espresso Blend (Espresso) - Brazil Bruzzi, Ethiopian Harrar, Sumatra Mandheling.  Espresso was pulled around ~1.5oz, with good body.  On Friday it was sweet with a slightly earthy finish, while on Saturday it was sweet blueberries on the front with a chocolate and caramel finish.  Espresso was prepared very well, and was particularly good on Saturday.

(Macchiato) - The blend works really well as a macchiato too - milk chocolate with a hint of berries.  One of the best macchiatos I have had in a while - the baristas really know their craft.

El Salvador Santa Ana Si Beria Bourbon (Espresso) - Delicious sweet front, with a buttery and tasty body, and a citrus/orange finish.  Really nice coffee, and great to have two options for espresso.  Definitely highlights what can be great about Single Origin Espressos.

Ethiopian Nekisse (Trifecta) - Ok, backstory. Sometime last summer, Cafe Grumpy in NYC offered an Ethiopian Nekisse for $12/cup. CBS early show even did a segment on it (http://bit.ly/dbvsTO). This is a similar coffee, and its $4 at Press.  If you appreciate lighter coffees with intense, interesting flavors, do not pass this up. Think, its the same price as a mocha as something.  The aroma was flowery, rose, tea, and blueberries.  The taste was sublime - juicy blueberries, with a tea-like quality. Clean, sweet, with great clarity.

Press Coffee pretty much embodies what every local roaster should aspire to be.  Every time we came, the baristas were inviting, friendly, and put a ton of care into their work. I visit a lot of coffee shops around the west coast, and I have to say that my experience at Press was the best I've ever had. Even the owner was friendly and happy to chat. What sets them apart is how they invite people to experience the coffee in a new way and learn about coffee without being off-putting, pompous, or rude.  They're doing a great job of sourcing good coffees, roasting, and getting the information about the coffee to the consumer.

If you drink coffee and live in the Phoenix area and haven't been here, then you need to asap. I only wish San Diego had a place like this - truly a gem.",rs0V36Mu3BMZ0SGbey2sVg
Food; Coffee & Tea,3OF6i6LTzRXpwNgodv7aeQ,Press Coffee Roasters,71,4.5,3.75,3,"Funny story....we were staying at a hotel 5.1 miles away. I know this because google maps told me so. Decided it would be fun to get the cruiser bikes that came with our outrageous ""resort fee"" (because we got 2 hours ""free"" each day) and ride to Press for morning coffee and brekkie.  Got on the bikes, pedaled over to N. Scottsdale Rd and we were on our way! Except.....that....I decided to check our progress after a little while and discovered we had gone the wrong way for a mile and a quarter. Sigh. Turn around, get yelled at by the hubby, kids think it's funny, and off we go. So by the time we got there, we were HUNGRY and THIRSTY! Our 5.1 mile one-way bike ride had become a little more than 7.5 miles.And let me tell you - that cappuccino tasted delicious.

So the next day, we drove. Guess what? Not as good. Still good....just not as good. The coffee was actually lukewarm when we got it. Thinking back, it was that way on the first day also...we were just unusually warm ourselves so didn't much care. Also, there was a bit too much milk for my taste....and I had purposely ordered a triple shot, knowing from the day before that they already put double shots in.  However, to be fair, this is also one of the never-resolved issues I have around wanting more espresso and less milk, but some milk, and foam, but don't want to guide someone through that whole thing. So it's rarely achieved. Except at Temple Coffee in Sacramento...but that's another review. Oh - but the Lemon Poppyseed muffin was the best one I've ever had in my entire life - moist, flavorful and lemony with rind. That was worth the trip right there.

I got a soy latte, and just like all of the best places, it's one double-shot, no matter what size you order. I do like that they have a 16oz size just for the people used to ordering a big drink, though. I opted for the 12 oz size and, despite the fact that it was quite warm outside and I was loving indulging in iced beverages while I was back in AZ , I knew that to really get the purest taste, it was best to go with a hot drink.

The owner (?) was also the barista and the cashier. Love that. He was happy to talk to me about the store, and how they had another location over at City North (that place is still around?) before this one. I used to work at a restaurant in the Scottsdale Quarter before any other shops opened up, and if this place was here then, I would have definitely been spending a lot of money here!

I don't understand why someone would go to Starbucks, or Coffee Bean, or even Coffee Planation or Jolta Java (I support the local places but come ON, get some higher quality beans if you want me to come back!) when this place is so much better! It's a perfect place to grab a latte while you're shopping or if you need a little resting spot because your arms are sore from carrying those shopping bags full of new clothes.

I love the atmosphere, very clean and bright in a warm way.  The only thing you really need to know about this place is that the staff and the owner is absolutely passionate about roasting and brewing coffee.

I've watched staff debate the absolute best way to brew a specific cup.  I've been asked to try a new brew method or grind and have yet to be disappointed.  I've talked with Steve ( one of the owners ) about his trip to South America to meet with coffee growers directly.  I've been impressed.

The true tell on how great Press Coffee is and why so many people love it is that I can drink their coffee black and it tastes amazing.  I've gone to so many places that pour asphalt into a cup, add corn syrup plus white color then call it coffee with a kick.  Its called not having to pay for good baristas because we serve corn syrup with caffeine.

So next time you're there try one of the cups black, I recommend the Amarro Gayo.  In between the rich earthy coffee flavor, you can actually taste the coffee's natural sweetness.  Press is one of the few places in town that has enough passion about coffee to be brave enough to serve coffee that way.

If you ever want to see your precious four stars, add almond milk to the inventory! I ain't even mad about the lack of bathroom. All I want is milk that isn't sweet and watery (rice milk), GMO'd and packing weirdy aftertaste (soy milk), or brimming with lactose.

The rice milk chai was pretty tasty (but be warned: 99% sweet, 1% spicy), and the butterscotch loose leaf tea was quite good, as well. Both would have been significantly better with almond milk, though, and the barista even said that that's all he uses at home.

While preparing for an event today, I found myself in need of a caffeine boost and hoped for a coffee shop in the Scottsdale Quarter. Wish and your dreams come true...or apparently that's the case in this situation! Enter Press Coffee. 

Situated off one of the alleys in the Scottsdale Quarter, this is a must-try for the caffeine crazed folks like me. The coffee shop isn't huge, but it's big enough to comfortably seat a couple high top tables, as well some other seating in addition to the outdoor tables surrounding the front. I walked in to be welcomed by two visitors enjoying a game of chess, a woman working on her computer and guests with their dogs out front. It looked like a comfortable setting to do some work or relax. 

The staff greeted me and I decided to go for an iced coffee with a splash of chocolate, sugar free vanilla and non-fat milk. I got a 16 oz (yes it was one of those days) and was pleasantly surprised at the $2 price tag. This is not what I expected at a coffee shop within the Scottsdale Quarter. 

The coffee was delicious! Now, normally, iced coffees pretty much all taste the same. However, the actual coffee in this iced coffee tasted different...in a good way! The iced coffee went down smoothly and almost tasted like a dessert treat. It gave me the energized kick I needed. 

If parking wasn't such a problem at Scottsdale Quarter, I would plan on visiting often, but I'll have to opt for only times when I have the time to find a parking spot and make it a leisurely trip.",4ozupHULqGyO42s3zNUzOQ

We went here one mid-week morning about a week ago.  I had read the reviews and looked at the menu online and thought this place would be right up my alley.  

First thought when we drove down High Street?  Plenty of good parking spots still available!  Actually, there was a parking lot on the north side that I was unaware of that had some cars, but the only people in Press was a quartet of PHX police officers.  I wanted to try one of their breakfast sandwiches but was disappointed in the lack of non-pork meat offerings on the sandwiches.  Would have been great if the server had asked if would like a sandwich w/ no meat for a discount, but he didn't.  Guess I could have asked...  Instead I got a chocolate chip muffin.  It was fine (nice touch that I had the option of them warming it up so the chocolate was nice and melty).  The coffee was just okay, nothing special but nothing wrong with it.

We ate outside, as their patio is shaded from the sun at the time we were there.  I enjoyed the patio (and the interior as well).  Very nice atmosphere.  I'm sure this will be a great place to go if (when?) CityNorth ever really gets going.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that there was a slow (but steady) stream of employees coming to some of the offices located there.

We ordered breakfast burritos which, at $5 a piece was a very reasonable price! They weren't huge, but everything tasted great and when compared to a chain bagel place, I felt I was getting a great value for the price.

Being preggers, I ordered a decaf coffee which they don't brew there, but they could make a large decaf Americano ($2.75) which is close to the same thing and tasted great -- especially for a decaf. The husband had an iced Chinese breakfast tea ($3.25) which was pretty great if I do say so myself.

I had been dating a gal name Starbucks for the past few years. She was a plain gal, generic if you will.  She was dependable and available. I was feeling as if i needed more out of my relationship, as you can imagine. 
So, at times, I would cheat on my gal with another gal named Coffee Bean. Coffee Bean was Kosher and a bit edgier, yet had a leaner list of qualities. 

I needed more out of my relationships. They say that when you're not looking for someone new, they appear. Well, that was the case with my new crush named Press. 

I had been to High Street for dinner Kona Grill, yet most of the other shops and restaurants were closed or not yet open for business at the time. 

I ventured back during daytime hours to give them another opportunity.  I had heard about Press, so I was more than excited to give it a go. At this point I was still making caffeine a part of my diet, so i ordered something called a ""Dirty Chai."" This was a Chai with espresso shots. Press uses a powdered Chai which, in my opinion, works better than the liquid or tea bag forms. I was also given the option to have my frothy delight in a ceramic cup.  I opted for that.  I felt like i was having the type of coffee house experience I had only just imagined. 

Press occupies a well appointed space, too.  From the wood and granite, to the stained concrete floors, I felt as if i were in a European city, not a Phoenix strip mall. The free wi-fi is a major plus, in my opinion. 
Press goes as far as to have a ""dog friendly"" cart outside, in its ample outdoor seating area. 

I spoke with Steve, the owner of Press, at length.  In talking, I asked how Press came to be, and he said that his wife had wanted to open a coffee shop one day.  Well Steve, you have certainly exceeded her expectations, as well as the residents of the Greater Phoenix area.

Uh anyway, PCFW is also a charming little coffee shop that utilizes its space well and feels at once airy and cozy. The huge table at the back seems tailor-made for Yelp gatherings and I got to meet some great yelpers, sip coffee, eat a cupcake and get a super secret ceviche tip that I will cherish forever. I ordered a regular old coffee, because anyone can fancy up coffee drinks with syrups, foams and loads of milk, but the test of a coffee shop should be its pure unadulterated drip/press. I went for a half-decaf and thought the taste was still rich and not at all bitter (which happens when the machines aren't cleaned, yuck!). I also didn't vibrate home so it wasn't overly steeped and I very much appreciated that. 

PCFW had a tasty-looking menu, namely the red pepper and smoked gouda soup and in the bakery case, a slice of chocolate cake that looked like pure fudge. I would go back for both items...but I didn't order either because Sarah G bewitched me with carrot cake cupcakes.

Coffee. Coffee. Coffee.

It stands out so much, I drive from Tempe to get Press.

We live in a world of relativity so it seems only natural I have to mention Lux. Yes Lux is closer and I do like Lux. However, Lux makes me feel AND ACT like a crack addict after I've had their coffee. Forget getting any work done, I need to run a million miles afterward.

Press on the other hand? Their coffee is like... smooth jazz. Try the regular latte with whole milk. No sugar. No syrup. Just pure fabulous gloriousness.

Coffee is the main focus here, at least by decor and by what most people were drinking this morning, and you can't resist noticing the craft beer taps as you enter the place.

For having been open a month or so the place has a dozen or so patrons milling around at all hours of the day.  I stopped by because I was tired of going to Starbucks and I've been coming here to work and enjoy hot beverages ever since.  WIFI is free for patrons but the crowd is more upscale than techy.

What do they serve you ask? Everything coffee, tea, chocolate, imported beer and wine.  Plus a great lunch menu of fresh sandwiches and salads that could pass for a decent meal at a gourmet bistro.  The coffee tastes great, not burned or excessively sweet.  You even get to drink it out of those cool San Francisco style over sized mugs.  The wine selection is around 30 different light and dark bottles between $5 and $16 a glass.  Check out their periodic wine tastings.

Food and drink aside any good cafe needs good atmosphere, and this one blows everything I've seen out of the water.  I genuinely want to be here at all times of the day.  Located on a quiet corner of the shops the large windows open during warm days onto a shaded terrace.  Facing the windows is a great granite bar with tall stools for sipping lattes and working on your Mac laptop.  Great for people watching.  Towards the back is a large oak table for group meetings while the front of the shop has a comfortable leather couch for relaxing.  The whole space is well lit by soft light thats easy to read by but elicits the best cafe atmosphere.  Evening include candle light, has to be seen to get the full effect. The music playing in the background is very good and the staff is absolutely amazing.

I've been here three times and already I'm on a first name basis with a few of the employees.  They're informed, helpful, and eager to make sure you have the best experience possible.  Its like this place has been a local spot for years.

So if you live in the north valley, skip Desert Ridge, forget Starbucks, and head straight to Press at City North.  Plus theres a Kona Grill within walking distance so you can spend all day here then go out for the evening.

Nearly emptied out their skim before it got to a drinkable strength, and by then it was cold.  The ""fresh baked"" muffins were very good, but they would only put one muffin of each flavor at a time in the display case, which made them look pitiful and not so fresh.

On the positive side, the staff was friendly and efficient.  The place was clean and nice and sunny, with coffee house decor you'd expect.  Don't know what they put in their water, but the other customers were all really attractive.  Hope some rubbed off.",FktbKOzznpoKTNXMVtc8EA

I had an iced tea and a veggie flatbread sandwich.  The sandwich was ok - it was served with mixed greens.  I would go more for the beverages and snacks than the food itself... and the atmosphere of course.

Anyway, putting that aside, my biggest gripe (in addition to the average espresso) is the wifi.  They give you a ticket with a code which says you purchased 60 mins of wifi.  TACKY TACKY.

We selected Press Coffee as the rendezvous.
I had not been there (and in fact, I hadn't made the right turn off the 101 to swing by City North).
Press Coffee is a very nice coffee house/wine bar. 
They serve a decent cup of coffee, have nice selection of breakfast pastries and breakfast food goodies. 
They seem to have a reasonable wine selection, and the menu to complement the wines (much, I suppose like Sportsman's, but frankly not as extensive a wine selection).
The atmosphere is also really pleasant...open, airy and comfortable inside with a huge patio (where we had our coffee) outside.
It looks like they have a number of events at Press, to generate some traffic...and Press needs traffic!
As pleasant as Press is, when I walked in at 7:00 am, I was the only person in the place...in fact, until my associate showed up, I may have been the only person (other than the guy behind the counter) moving in City North.
We sat outside on the patio by the front door for nearly 2 hours and saw maybe 10 people go into Press...that can't be good!
In all candor, I haven't been there in the evening and maybe the joint jumps at night.
But, it doesn't seem like a lot of people live there and it really doesn't seem like a destination (about 5 stores all selling women's clothing or shoes, as near as I could tell...along with a couple of restaurants that are open and a few places that are ""under construction""...with nobody actually constructing).
Although Press makes a good cup of coffee and they have a wine bar, it frankly won't be in my regular rotation.
It's a long way out there and even if I'm in the neighborhood, there are more shops, restaurants, coffee shops, wine bars and the rest 2 miles in either direction at Desert Ridge or Keirland, so there isn't much reason to take the 56th St. exit.

 I love the yogurt and granola parfait (strawberry and vanilla yogurt for me with a bit of honey and light granola) for breakfast with a white chocolate latte. Also, the breakfast burritos are perfectly creative and filling. For lunch, my favorite is the cactus club panini with a small side salad.
 Also worth mentioning is that they have the VERY BEST iced coffee around. They call it an iced toddy and any one of the employees would be happy to tell you how it is different from regular coffee. I just know that it tastes amazing and seems to have a bit more of a caffeine kick!
  My favorite part about Press are their delectable desserts! The berry mascarpone cake pretty much makes you feel like you've won the lottery. And the ghirardelli brownies and chocolate chip cookies (warmed up) are a weekly addiction of mine.

I easily found a parking spot just outside Press and headed inside.  

I was immediately greeted by two different employees with big smiles and ""How are you this morning!?"".  Good first impression.  The space is casually upscale and feels very comfortable with couches up front, a long laptop bar along the side and a large group table in the back.  The patio outside is awesome as well and ""pet friendly"".  One of the employees told me they are planning a Doggy Dinner in a couple weeks out the patio and that they already have sold out.  Pretty unique and neighborhood friendly idea.

I ordered a small Americano which was served right up and headed outside to sit on the patio and enjoy the sun.  Free wi-fi is provided (90 minutes with a code provided at purchase) and I enjoyed surfing around while soaking up the beautiful morning.  The place was lively the entire time I was there with families, couples, and a few dogs out of the patio.  Good vibe.

I decided to try out the Chai that I had read about in Marc's review and it was really great.  I also ordered the Club Panini which was served with some chips and a sweet pickle.  Great sandwich.  Simple, clean, perfect Saturday afternoon Bistro food.

I didn't sample any of the wine but I did talk to the owner Steve for a while about the evenings and it sounds like they have a real passion for wine and the wine bar experience.  If it is as good as the coffee/morning experience, it must be great.  I need to plan a trip back to enjoy a few glasses soon.

The woman at the register was sweet and easy to talk to. Originally, I was going to order a regular drip coffee, but my eyes wandered over to their specials board and saw ""Mexican Mocha."" I asked the barista about it, and she informed me that it was a mocha with a warm, spicy twist.

Sure enough, the taste of the mocha was quite shocking. I've had Mexican mochas in the past, but nothing like this one. Spicy upon first sip, I couldn't decide how I felt about it. But after the first sip, with the spicy warmth stuck in my throat, the next sequential sips were no longer surprising. The spice was meant to warm the drinker on a cold morning, while still being a pleasant beverage.

If given the opportunity, I would surely return to this wonderful coffee establishment!",qG66kK46MfouvfoUvunPMg

Damian, Danielle and the rest of the C3 crew bust their humps to make sure that every customer feels special and part of their java family. Their efforts have certainly paid off quickly, building an army of loyalists in just two short months.
In addition to the standard menu of hot, cold and blended coffee drinks, City Central offers teas, sodas, pastries and a very  nice selection of grilled panini sandwiches. Damian has been a coffee pioneer in Downtown Phoenix since the mid-90s and his expertise is obvious.
The atmosphere is superb. Free Wi-Fi, a nice selection of Pandora music playing throughout the tastefully decorated flat, newspapers and magazines for leisure reading, comfy seating, and a nice patio overlooking bustling Central Avenue.

The atmosphere is cool, comfortable, and inviting.  Not like other super-hip and trendy ""you're lucky we let you in here"" places.  Couches to lounge in or a big 'community' table to enjoy your food and drink, and a bar to watch them work their magic.  Oh, and there is great music playing, I always know I'm going to walk out with a good song stuck in my head.  How often does that happen?!  

The staff is laid-back and friendly and always ready with a yummy drink suggestion when you're just not sure what you're in the mood for.  That's how I found my new addiction, the almond milk latte!  An amazing list of delicious drinks on the wall behind the counter.  And speaking of the counter, they use the square wallet app which is always convenient.

Breakfast and lunch options.  My favorites for breakfast are the quiche, the ""early-riser"" (bagel and egg sandwich), or a cup of oatmeal - THEY'LL EVEN STEAM THE MILK FOR YOU so it's nice and creamy and you get a little protein with the oats!

The pastries are delicious when I want to treat myself.  The one that I can't say, and won't even try an spell, has a little fruit and ricotta baked inside to make it perfectly creamy with just a hint of fruit flavor.  And, it isn't too big so I don't feel like I broke the calorie bank by 8 am.

I could go on, but instead, I'll highly recommend that you go check it out for yourself!  If you're looking for a caffeine fix, some good food, and a cool, cozy atmosphere, you won't be sorry!",AirVzN1BVQBmq5zY0YMNYQ

Mama Java's fulfilled one of my requirements: it was definitely not  a place I could nap at.

To be fair, this is a coffee shop, not a whore house so ignore my last comment. 

What I meant was that it isn't a cozy place, rather cold, actually. I'm used to smaller coffee places where its warm from the steaming coffee cups, the closeness of people sitting around me and the many couches or arm chairs. I just need a hug at Mama Java's. 

There was only one guy at the counter when I was there and a long line but I don't have anything important to get to so I didn't mind the wait. I ordered a non-fat chai latte and it okay. Too sugary and strong spices.

I ordered a Cafe Mocha soy...and he charged me 50 cents for the soy (ERRRRRR). I wanted at least a fruit cup but there was only a bowl of some bananas, an apple and an orange for the fruit options. My total was like almost 8 bucks-I could have had a full breakfast and coffee at Wildflower Bakery for that amount! The cafe person warned me my knish may be too ""peppery"". My friend was so hungry she got the ham and cheese sandwich...made with american cheese. No fruit, chips, whatever and a coffee. We sat by the window and perused the lackluster books for browsing (1989 travel guides to Portugal, anyone?) although we did end up on the sofa laughing at Garfield books someone had left.

Products take on the name as the product, i.e Band-aid, Levis, Q-tip, Duck Tape, ect. I think it is VERY rude to correct a customer when you know what they mean. This happened to me - I should have stated Medium however I forgot and said Grande - OMG shoot me now, the look of disgust and the correction. I wanted to take my $4 back and go to Sbux, at least they don't correct you and the customer is always right 

This become more evident when I was at Tuesday morning with a friend and I told her we should grab some coffee, but I actually had to tell her before we went in to not say Grande. She laughed her light hearted self and rolled with it. Really though, I have to tell a friend make sure you order correctly. 

Anyway, the last straw was yesterday when my boyfriend asked for cream in his ice coffee and they stared at him like it was crazy. I get wanting to be a liberal elitist, I think of my self as one sometimes. You just can't forget the customer is the business. If you know what they mean roll with it - DONT correct them.

I am so not a fan of a super bright coffee shop. I like some nice dim lighting with comfy chairs and couches. They have mostly little bistro tables with wood chairs, not so comfy. Mama Java's is more a wall of windows and very bright light. I am not saying it is wrong, just not where I want to hang.

This place could probably be a nice place to hang out at with a makeover. Some drapes, more comfy chairs and sofas, a dimmer switch. Calling all designers, please do a makeover.

The espresso was decent, and I had a ham and cheese on a croissant that was basic but good. Although a little lettuce on the sandwich wouldn't have hurt. It really was just ham and cheese, good, but nothing to write home about.

Food; Coffee & Tea,Mb46iSlA4qmTwXf-WrqtQA,Mama Java's Coffee House,79,4,3.46,4,"The short: It's all solidly good--the not-too-pricey coffee, the simple pastries, the breakfast sandwiches and knishes, the baristas, and the comfortable and mellow atmosphere when going solo or meeting a few friends. 

The long: Located on the southeast corner of Indian School and 36th St., in the strip mall between Tuesday Morning and Darwin's, MJ's is accessible and fairly easy to sign. The wall of windows lights the place up awesomely, and even at night, it doesn't turn into one of those dark, moody coffee joints. They find new artists to show art every couple of months or so, and it's usually pretty good. Their couple handfuls of small tables are easy to shift around if you're joining a group, but big groups might feel uncomfortable since it's not exactly huge. There's a nice quiet room around the back for people studying, but it's not enclosed, so on open mic nights or nights when there are featured performers, it's not so quiet. I love how clean they keep the place; when the baristas aren't working the counter, they're wiping down the windows, bussing tables, and restocking the coffee condiment bar. 

Speaking of the baristas, they're always friendly and attentive, good at showing off how to hustle (because when a coffee shop's busy, I feel better if baristas actually act like it), and totally interesting to look at--like fashion icons for today's college-aged generation, some with interesting piercings and tattoos, fashionable and stylish by not trendy clothes--seems like there's an appreciation for staff who are unique, interesting, and good workers. It's never uncomfortable, though--meaning, I never feel too old or unhip or out of place there. Customers truly run the gamut, from quiet middle-aged women catching up with each other, moms and/or dads with kids, suit-and-tie professionals stopping in for a cuppa, people hitting the wi-fi, and angsty artsy types having heated but civil political debates. 

I usually have the chai tea latte, but their coffee is always solid (I can attest to a decent café mocha), and I hear a lot of praise about their daily specials--every day, a different bean, special coffee, and iced tea. Prices are a little cheaper than Starbucks (I think it was $2.50 for the tasty mango lemon iced tea, and the larger specialty coffees can go up to $4.50), but the drinks are better. Pastries are always tasty and include a small selection of rugalah (buttery, flaky, chocolatey goodness--also available with raspberry or apple), a bigger selection of muffins, big and puffy croissants, bagels, cookies, brownies, rice krispie treats--certainly not a fully stocked French patisserie, but what they have is usually really good quality.

Food: A little pricey, but the food is always pretty good. Their macaroni and cheese is cheap, though, and awesome (5 bucks). You can get it with jalapeno and bacon (7 bucks). Sometimes, they even have pesto and chicken in it. They start serving dinner at 5:30. Their breakfast is always pretty good, too, and they always have a variety of different quiches.

Staff: All pretty nice and the more you come there, the more social they will be with you. If any even minor inconvenience arises, they're pretty good about spotting the charge, but it rarely happens that they have to do that. 

Environment: Yes, there are a ton of hipsters there, but that's kind of to be expected with good coffee shops in any city.

I used to enjoy the interesting and happy, laid back crowd of people that tended to flock to Lux to sip a coffee while working on their laptops or chatting for a while over a dessert. 

 For some reason- is it the larger meals?  the alcohol?  the bigger more comfortable seats?  the typewriters?  the extra bathroom?- the new Lux draws a totally different demographic... mostly over 40 and under 5.  Think yoga pants or church dresses... with a bunch of poorly behaved kids yelling ""Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom.... DAD!"", running, and twirling around in a crowded space with adults carrying full-to-the brim coffee cups.

Younger/trendy crowd seems to get drinks to go now.  Those who stay are ogled by mid lifers who want to know all about your computer or your cell phone and have no qualms about interrupting your work for a free tech lesson.  You also run the risk of toddlers sipping from your straw if your drink is left on the table.  

Or maybe you will enjoy being pushed out of the way by a 40 year old woman in yoga pants who simply MUST get her iced mocha right this second?  If not, you may want to get that coffee to go... quickly!

Their mixed alcoholic drinks have all been excellent, although pricey.  My favorite is the slightly odd margarita they make, and it takes about five minutes to create, so be patient, but it's well worth the time.

coffee, pastries, and environment all maintain their top-shelf qualities. inside seating room was always an issue, but not near as much anymore. And the places to sit are all very hip, cool set-ups - not just 10 look-a-like tables and chairs. 

My only problem? How they've laid out their customer flow. One prob at the old place was there was always an awkward bottleneck of people waiting for their drinks... and to my amazement, they've cloned the problem at their new place! Unreal! Whoever space-planned the new layout should be shot! ""i have an idea - because this place gets really busy, lets direct the long line of people into a little circle in front of the register, make this the same spot people wait for / pickup their drinks, and also the same place people use the condiment bar, and we'll have everyone awkwardly climbing over each other.

The aroma when you walk in is a savory fragrance of roasted coffee and is truly delightful.  Their coffee is full flavored with palatible goodness from start to finish.  Their homemade pastries are scumptious and compliment your cup of joe or hot tea very well.

The barista's are cool, friendly and very accomodating.  Lux is very small so most of the time I will get my cup of joe to go.  Their decor has a very ""coffee house"" feel and they have some seating outside which is user friendly below 100 degrees outside, lol!

I almost didn't write this review since I'm at this Phoenix hot spot all the time.  However, I realized something earlier Saturday when I went inside a competitor's store searching for something to satisfy my sweet tooth.  

I walked in competitor x, scanned my choices, and walked out.  

That's when I made a beeline for Lux.  Hands down, Lux has the best dessert selection around.  Not only is everything made from scratch at this locally owned business, but the quality is outstanding, and in most cases the portions are generous.    

Wanna know the best part?  Sometimes the desserts have those crusty edges, you know, like homemade! The chain coffee houses might see this as a flaw - but at Lux the imperfections make this coffee bar perfect.

The ""bar"" is in the back and distinguished by all the liquor bottles.  Easy enough.  But I had heard that they had sandwiches and what not now.  I saw an area that looked like where they made food, but was unsure as if I was supposed to order from them or from the barista.  When I asked if they had a menu, she said, ""We are your menu.""  Um.... ok.  Is that the hipster thing to do now?  I'm a girl who likes options.  I didn't know what my particular craving was that day and I like to know what my choices are.  I also like to know prices.  I ordered my old stand by of a medium vanilla soy latte and the man got a double espresso and it came out to almost $8.

I have been to Lux countless times over the last few years. It has always been the place to see and be seen, with coffee service that is definitely above Starbucks, but I will admit struggles in certain areas. 

Lux, in its former space, was a small shop, always packed and definitely had its crowd. If you weren't a part of the crowd, you'd receive a ""look"" of, ""hey, who are you?!"" Look past that and hop in line for a cappuccino and it would make up for it.

The new space, well... it caters to the exclusivity of the ""hipster"" crowd. Walk through the door that you THINK is the entrance... and wander around. The kitchen, espresso bar and cocktail bar are all broken up and there is no definitive flow of service. Also, is that a customer wearing the tight jeans and cardigan? Or is that the staff? Who knows? Luckily I have a friend who works there and was kind enough to show me around and how the flow of service works. If you're not that lucky, best of luck to you, as you're left to your own sense of direction as how to order, sit down, etc. From what I gather, you can order an espresso drink and sit wherever and they'll call your name when your drink is ready. However, I'm not sure about the cocktail bar. The only way I think you would order would be by sitting at the bar? Not sure about ordering food from the kitchen.

I will admit, I haven't ordered any food from Lux yet, apart from a pastry for my coffee. I had a croissant, which was pretty good and went really well with my cappuccino. I'm a fan of a free-pour cappuccino, however the cappuccino that I was served on this visit had the foam scooped on top. This confused me, because I saw other customers order a cappuccino and get one free-pour. Maybe it depends on the barista? Kind of inconsistent. I did sit down at the awkward cocktail bar and order a drink. The bar has normal height seating and a raised bar for the bartender. It's awkward when they lean down and tower over you to deliver a drink. Anyway, I ordered the ""Number 47"" cocktail with gin, Green Chartreuse, St. Germain, lime, mint and cucumber. I'm a huge fan of Green Chartreuse and gin so I was excited to try it. They didn't have any cucumber in house, so they made it without it. Jeff (the owner) commented, ""Well today it's just the 46."" Hmm... Alright. So I took a sip of the cocktail. It was decent. Nothing exciting at all. It was overpowered by the mint and the lime in the cocktail. It masked the green Chartreuse too much. It really NEEDED that cucumber to mellow out the mint and lime so you could taste all of the ingredients.

Oh well... what can you do when the owner doesn't seem to mind that ingredients are missing? 

Overall, props to Lux for being busy at 3pm on a Thursday afternoon and being a successful establishment, which may be from the same established clientele from before the expansion. The coffee and pastry has remained the same, which is ok with me. However, the cocktail bar tries a little too hard, I think. Also, the decor and vibe has definitely turned Lux into the ""hipster mecca"" and excluded the general public from it's demographic. Which, I can't complain or comment too much, because they are doing just fine. The flow of the restaurant is choppy and confusing and the staff is less than considerate (with a few exceptions). There's my two cents, for whatever it's worth.",vTvxsif_dlYJOtFxS-t2RQ

The coffee is impeccable and the food is delicious. That first sip of my soy hazelnut latte is always the most delicious and compares to no other coffee. This is what keeps me coming back. 

If you want to sit for a while, make sure you arrive at the right time. And keep in mind the right time is never the same time. You pretty much have to get lucky to find a good spot. I've started getting my coffee to go. Also, they don't open until 7AM. This is when my shift starts, so I can no longer go before work.

I like the fact that I can pace myself to discover new menu items here.  From a business perspective, I like to see how management plan to promote and market their new and expanded offerings.

Like the prior place, the music is still a notch too loud. The art on the wall is not memorable but then again they probably will rotate the selection.

I hadn't been by in a few years but Lola coffee had locked their doors at 8:30pm (wtf???), so lucky for me, Lux is right down the street. It wasn't too busy although there was a very steady stream of people in and out. I had a small, non-fat sugar free vanilla latte ($4) and picked up a homemade, oatmeal creme sandwich for $3. 

Pluses: I love the msmatched, kind-of random decor that makes you feel very comfortable. Free WiFi, and a wide variety of baked goods. I can ALWAYS be sold on baked goods. This might be a weird plus, but I was totally loving their ice water with fresh oranges inside. I am probably the only person that never had this before, but who cares, I loved it. Totally refreshing on a hot AZ night. 

Neutral: The employees weren't exactly friendly but weren't rude, either...just kind of indifferent. Hmmm, correct that, they were very friendly with the regulars but I sort-of felt unwelcome at first but I quickly got over that. 

Negatives: The music is too loud. Maybe that was intentional towards the end of the night but I was having an extremely difficult time focusing on what I was studying. Don't get me wrong, I loved the music but it was a bit much. Okay, alot much.

With delicious baked goods (I had a date scone...I don't really even LIKE dates, but the scone was delicious!) including cupcakes and handmade drinks (and you can choose disposable to-go cups or earth-saving ceramic -- love it!), it's adorable. All of it, not just the adorable woman working the register.

We wound up sitting outside, but there was a good deal of room inside too, where people of all backgrounds were busy working away on their macs, with a scattered PC here and there.

Parking was plentiful, something I'm always on the lookout for, and while I did have to wait in line to order, it moved quickly.

I jumped on the lightrail and headed up from downtown since it is only about 4 stops, but I screwed up and got off at Indian School. Don't do this, or you're walking. Stay on one more stop, and you're here!

Walking up to the place, it was pretty cool. Sail material over communal long tables makes it easy to meet new people, or relax in the shade with your caffeine and earphones. I wanted to work inside since I'd planned to stay for several hours (papers to grade!) so I headed in. The line wasn't too bad (I hear it can get bad some hours of the day) and the barista was really friendly. I got my usual (a black coffee) and it was $2.00. No problem. The ambiance struck me immediately. The lights were very soft and easy to work under. There were about 30 people, two dozen of them were on laptops, most were MACs, and since I too am an Apple FanBoy, I was stoked. Grabbed a seat near the cash register across from a beautiful woman studying religion and medicine (checked out her books next to her MacBook). I hate when the coffee is too hot (Starbuck's), and this coffee was perfect. Shot some pics, booted up my MacBookPro, logged into the free wireless, and I've been sitting here ever since.

They were not cheap ($1 a piece and not particularly large), but I believe in spending a bit more for small business's sake and good quality. That's why I was so disappointed. The coconut macaroons were so hard that they completely crumbled when biting into them. I am still not sure if they were just old or just poorly made.

I went twice in the course of a couple of weeks and the trips averaged a rating of ""eh.""

Trip #1: Girl barista is nice, suggests upsizing from a small-sized chai latte to a medium because the small is only slightly larger than a shot glass.  It's midweek in the p.m. so the place isn't too busy, making it a nice place to relax.  Sadly, the chai is lackluster.  It tastes kind of watered down.  My friend has the Velvet, which is way better.  When it's time to leave, there is some confusion as to where the garbage can is located (Answer: way in the back).

Trip #2: Guy barista is a bit snotty.  Again it's suggested that I upsize to the medium (why even have the small really?) and then is a bit pissy when I tell him I really only want the Velvet in a small.  I say no thank you to the whipped cream, trying to muster some sort of self-control.  When I go to pick up my drink, the barista is putting some whipped cream on my friend's drink.  ""The whipped cream is really good,"" he tells me.  I hesitate, watching him dole out the tasty confection and he sees me.  ""You already said no,"" he says as he closes up the container and smugly puts it back under the counter.  Now, maybe he's trying to be funny, but if that's the case, he needs to work on his delivery because it just comes off as being snotty.  The place is full of people tonight.  My friend and I sit on the white chairs up towards the front.  There are dirty plates and cups on all the tables and everything is just a bit askew.  It just feels a bit grimy.  My Velvet is only okay.  It's probably much better with the whipped cream.

Overall, I just kind of got a pretentious vibe from the place.  I feel like I can get a tastier Chai and way less attitude over at Copper Star.",-QT_e-7VSun5c2z85k_k5A

You see, sometimes I go in and ask for a soda from the fridge in the back.  They usually pretentiously tell me to get it myself, as if I'm the only person who forgot to read the LUX Etiquette Handbook, Vol,4.  Im ok with getting it myself, thats all good.  But then the next time I go, i try to get it myself and an employee cuts me off as i attempt to open the fridge and says:

 ""Uhhh, can I help you?""  

I say, ""well, last time they told me to get the soda myself?""   

She says, ""Only when we're busy""


Yet it was more busy then than the previous time. 

So to all the lux regulars, how many people is considered busy, or is there some other way in determining this.

Also, i always ask for whipped cream.  Half the time they put it on, half the time they don't.  Thats too bad because the whipped cream is amazing.

Last note, the arrogance, pretentiousness, self-obsessed, elitist vibe is uncanny.  Not the physical place, but the people.  If you don't walk in with a with that certain ""I know good coffee and I'm special""  attitude, they stare at you like an alien.  Oh, and you have to have a mac laptop too.

Food; Coffee & Tea,aRkYtXfmEKYG-eTDf_qUsw,Lux,461,4,3.87,3,"Things I like in a coffee house...

1. Oddly, not coffee. I really am not a coffee person which leads me to...

2. Tea. I like tea. Tea and me are friends and when the barrista/o knows just as much about his teas as he does his coffees, then I am always impressed.

3. FREE wifi. I've been traveling a lot lately and I never really appreciated the beauty of free wifi til recently. You get ripped off at hotels, airports, etc, so when a place like this doesn't charge you to chill and enjoy your time here while surfing for midget porn, then I am very grateful.

4. Good people watching. Let's face it. I observe people for a living. I don't technically get paid for this, but I do it and so, I require a nice amount of characters to check out. Last night offered a dude wearing sunglasses...at night, along with two gay guys on a first date. Always VERY entertaining to watch someone else's awkward encounter unfold. ""So, where did you go to elementary school?"" ""I hate when coffee is too strong!"" ""yada yada yada."" (PS, they left to go for a ""walk"" so maybe it did go well)

5. A cool bathroom. I know this may seem odd, but I love cool bathrooms and loathe gross ones. There is no middle ground for me. Sadly, Lux falls into the latter and it was guuross! The attempt at art is...interesting though, and by interesting I mean, not so much, but hey, at least it distracts you from looking around at the wet floor and paper towel explosions and dirty counters.

So how does Lux weigh in on my 5 list. I think at a solid 3.5. Overall, the atmosphere was a tad sterile for my taste. I generally prefer really cozy couches and warm tones and cool lighting instead of white walls and somewhat fluorescent lighting.

~Taste: * * * * * the coffee brewed and sold here is perfect, the confections and baked goods are simply wonderful.
~Decor: * * * * * note the striking array of chairs and seating, along w/ additional patio seating make for optimal outside and inside digs
~Pricing: * * * * * nothing here is expensive, and considering the quality of the product sold, very economical
~Service: * * * * * the barristas are helpful, friendly and good natured, perfectly willing to explain the menu and offer tips advice, please tip them!

If I were limited to rail travels, I'd tout its easy accessibility it is to the rail, but I had a car, and it's in a convenient location that at worst, requires a U-turn to get to.  Parking was a little sparse, but I was able to get a spot, probably because I was hitting it up after the real main morning rush.

The interior of the place was unique, and sub-sectioned to about three or four different mini-lobbies of some sort.  It's cozy and inviting in most of them, but you better like your fellow man if the picnic benches are the last place to sit.

I went for just coffee, so I didn't experience the food, although lots of people attest to it being really good.  As far as coffee was concerned, out of the five, I guess local coffee joints I hit up in Phoenix, Lux probably had the best coffee of them all.  The staff were all friendly and pleasant peoples, and they mowed through the lines of people efficiently and with smiles on their face.  It's a truly good atmosphere there, and despite the pretty hipster crowd, the air of smug arrogance isn't as prevalent from those who lounge there.

I did not however, expect it to be packed at 9:30 at night, half an hour before closing.  I ordered a latte; it was smooth and rich.  I would have mistaken it for a breve (made with half and half instead of milk) but I watched the barista make it and I'm sure it was done correctly.

I'd even have settled for being able to break things just by screaming. But alas, instead of super powers all I got where good looks and charm. It's not easy, but I try to live with it as best I can.

Yesterday something happened to me, though. Something extraordinary. Something that cannot be explained with science. Or logic. Or even algorithms (I tried.) I believe I may have stumbled upon the secret to my secret abilities.

Amanda B and I came to Pane Bianco after the Anti-Prop 102/Prop 8 rally. I was hungering for equal rights and social justice, but in the meantime I had to settle for salad and bread.

While waiting for our food Amanda turned to me and said ""I'm going over to Lux. You want anything?""

And without thinking I said ""Sure. Surprise me.""

I swear to Cthulu the entire restaurant froze in place. The two girls at the counter, Amanda, even the guy in the make making my salad, everyone, for the briefest of moments, were trapped in stasis by my naivety. 

By the power of n00bity, I had stopped time. Fuck. How do I unstop it?

Thankfully Amanda, who over time has built an immunity to my occasional outburst of teh dumb, fixed the situation.

""Ummmm...there's a lot to choose from. Maybe you want to make it more specific?""

""Yeah, hahaha."" Oh. Great. The girl at the counter has unfrozen herself too, isn't that nice.

""Perhaps coffee...tea...""

""Tea. Iced. Something fruity."" I tried to laugh the whole incident off, but there was no denying it, we all felt it; I almost broke Pane Bianco with my stupid. 

Soz.

After uncomfortably waiting on the patio (my ""ironically mis-matching outfit"" didn't work out like I had planned and the other patrons let me know it), I went into Lux to find Amanda, where I felt the smallest tuggings of belonging. With an interior this tacky, my outfit (comic book t-shirt, rolled up jeans, long black stripped socks, layers of bracelets, pink  faux pearls and business jacket...yeah...) and I fit right in. 

If only I had a Mac and a web design project I kept putting off to look at xkcd. 

Amanda got me the peach iced tea which I enjoyed immensely. 

Peach is one of those fruits, like grapes and green apples, whose actual flavor has been all but lost after decades of synthesized flavors (I predict that in ten years, at this rate, I won't even know what a real grape tasted like). 

But Lux's peach tea tasted like real peach. I can't say if they actually used real peach or if they just used some sort of syrup, but whatever they used tasted delicious. 

I keep hearing about how awesome their cupcakes are, and in the future I will possibly order one, but first I have to avoid that kneejerk ""Ugh!"" reaction I give when anyone asks me if I want the ""vegan"" option, like that time I giggled and said ""Soy milk? No thanks. I just want regular milk for a regular person"" to the barrista at the Starbucks on my campus.

I will  admit I have an irrational fear of soy, but I am willing to do the right thing and give it a try.

In the meantime, I'm going to see if maybe I can develop a different super power. I mean, stopping the world in its tracks with dumb comments is nice and all, but it's not going to get me featured in any comic books.

I just realized this is a perfect excuse to get some rope and make some people tell the truth.

There are too many other good coffee shops in Central PHX that don't flip me the attitude the way you do.

It's like an abusive relationship. You treat me like crap, make me wait in epic-length  lines because your staff is inefficient and the set up in your store is a 100% cluster with the line dead-ending. People pushed together like a NYC subway on the weekends waiting for the drinks. Pushing. Annoyed. Not. Okay.

They don't make eye contact, they don't remember what you ordered half the time. They may ring you up for the wrong drink even. And usually if you ordered a pastry ... they forget that too.  

No more abuse. The last time we came in I said no more. From the time we walked in the door to when we got our drinks it took exactly 34 minutes. The line wasn't even *that* long - they just flat out sucked. That is bat-shit crazy. I am sorry, but it is. And the dude with the skinny tie rolled his eyes at me and didn't stamp my card. Bitch, moan, bitch, moan, and repeat. I know, whine and take a right at pathetic. But when you pay 10 bucks for two drinks you should at least get some common courtesy.

After several visits, and I mean several, for coffee, spirits, breakfast, lunch, and dinner I finally have a good analogy. Lux is like a really well made video game. They've thought of everything, focused on all the details. From the light fixtures to the typewriters, everything seems to have some thought put into it. 

And just like a really good video game, it's nearly impossible to figure out if you've never experienced it before.

Make no mistake, Lux has a code, and it requires decoding. But once you crack the code, Lux shines.

I cringe every time I see a newbie walk in from the streets. Where do I go for coffee? What about food? This bar looks nice, but wait it's a bar? What's in this room? What about this room over here? Am I standing in storage space now or waiting for the bathroom? 

The first time I came in I felt the eyes of the staff following me as I bounced from room to room, counter to counter trying to find the way.

But now? Now I'm an expert and I know the best thing to do is find a seat first, drop your belongings, THEN get in line. I now know the best place to wait for your drink or lunch is not at your seat but at the counter. I now know the menu is taped to the glass wall typed in 12pt font. I am now intimately familiar with what times I can get food from the kitchen versus only baked goods. I now know I will probably move seats at least 3 times as I ""upgrade"" to the better seats next to outlets and with more comfortable chairs. I now know the staff really are great people but are possibly under more duress than they'll admit? Keep smiling guys!

Now that I know the code, I can enjoy Lux. And enjoy it, I do! But it sure took some practice.

I used to not be able to focus in here with all the 'scene-y' stuff (alluded to in other reviews) but now i've found that if i have work to do the noise and the people kind of make me motivated. It can get really dull working at your desk in your house.

I like that people hate so much on the mac-using, trendy people in the shop. Seriously? Who gives a shit?

The whipped cream here is prooooobably the best thing I've ever tasted, like, ever. I can't rave about it enough. But when you put it on top of a perfectly sweetened, creamy, icy, doesn't-even-really-taste-like-coffee beverage, it's heaven.

I think Lux is an amazing example of authentic excellence. Whenever I think about branding, Lux always comes to mind as a great example. They know exactly what they are. They don't try to be anything else. They do an amazing job of executing every part of who they are.

First of all, the coffee rocks. They roast their own beans and are our favorite in town. Then the drinks they make are not only delicious but also beautiful. So many nice touches. Latte art. Homemade whipped cream with a touch of  honey. Sugared rim & slice of lemon on the lemonade. Fresh squeezed juices. McClendon Farms honey as a condiment. They serve their drinks in china & glass (cool non-institutional mugs & glasses) if you're drinking there. They even have killer lids for their to go coffee. Their straws are super thick & you never have to worry about them getting crimped.

If it didn't all taste good, I guess it wouldn't matter. But it does & every little aspect adds to the experience for me.

Same with their food. Great snacks. Served on china. Heated & served with a slab of real butter if it's supposed to be.

Cool decor. Changing local art on the walls. Great music playing. Free wifi.

The only thing that bugs me at all about Lux is how crowded it's become. In the scheme of things, I guess that's good because we know Lux will be around & it also says a lot for the taste of Phoenicians.

I have heard one other criticism - that the folks there can be snooty. I myself have never seen that & experienced the absolute opposite time after time. I often come with 2 little kids too so I'd expect if anybody was going to get the snoot, it'd be me.

At the tables to the left were Europeans shootin the shit and taking pictures, laughing it up. The counter was low and while the pastries looked bangin, they weren't labeled and under kind of frosted domes, so a little hard to figure out what they were. I prefer pastries in the morning, anyway, no big deal. Both of the staff there were friendly and made me a Soy Chai for 2.50 (no extra for the soy-YES) and it was a REAL soy chai-no mix! Delicious. Under the counter were shelves-some with business cards and flyers. Another set had tons of magazines to borrow and freebies. Another shelf had kids books and colouring supplies (awww). The place looked clean and people were pretty happy to be there. I settled in near the front window on a low seat with a Business Week, Surface, Vogue and a book I was working on. I looked around some more and while I liked the white motiff...the problem with white? It gets dirty. And yeah...it looked a little unkempt. It felt a bit like a rumpus room. Not the best feeling. But so shabby mod! The artwork was well-displayed and attractive to the all-white decor and all kinds of different people of different race, age, backgrounds came and went in the hour I was there. The bathroom was well kept and I noticed they had Meyers products for toilet bowl and hand cleaner-I thought that was pretty kick-ass.

As they prepared to shut down, there were still groups of people just hanging out outside at the benches. Definitely a great coffee house and curious as to how it is during the day!",mfvezpz6ohS0NQk3DZdvqQ

This place has what I would like to think the word 'Panache' was named after!

You walk through a very modest door into a world of peace.  Where the people sitting at their laptops (throughout), are the plumage of contentment.  Typing away at cyberworld, and sipping some of the BEST Coffee that is probably brewed in this part of the region of Phoenix!  The beans are roasted on-site, and the flavor of the latte' I had was beyond belief!  So was the texture!---Like silk!  WOW!  I was so bummed that I came during my work lunch-break and couldn't stay longer than 20 minutes or so for my first visit...Not the way I like to roll with such terrific coffee.  I like to chill out and take it all in...Oh well...I will be back!
The setting is very comfortable for the lounger that wants to just sit and sip a cup of java and carouse the cyber connections out there.  There are cubby places to sit for all tastes, and the folks there filled most of them!  The motif is very earthy and the lighting is just right.

I gave it four stars instead of five because with such a gift as they have for making and serving some of the best in the industry, they need to have a larger sit-down area or areas to welcome and bless even more guests...+++",meuqHEjGCmrO3zDlr6OU7w

Quite honestly, I was very surprised. I'm not a coffee house kind of girl. I'm more of a sit in bookstore and read the book without buying it girl or sit in Panera and stuff my face while making my laptop keyboard greasy type of girl. But I could become coffee house girl very easily if I lived close. Lux is just so freaking cute, and so cool. I felt hip. 

Now, if you are not a coffee drinker, do NOT fear. Their non-coffee beverage selection is very good. They serve Republic of Tea brand and they have quite a few options. I had a chai tea latte, which was a tad disappointing but tasty nonetheless. 

I have to agree with Jacqui, I wish there were some savory options available. I was here with the book club and my dumb ass didn't eat lunch, but having a sweet wasn't appealing. I wanted some substance. Oh well.

I also had a peach upside down muffin which resembled a piece of pineapple upside down cake.  It was also really really delicious.  

I love the mix of modern, antique, and industrial.  I was there on a Saturday afternoon and there was a lot of seating available. The ladies room was clean.  There were some dirty dishes scattered around the place, but it was busy and I didn't really care- they were all picked up by the time we left.  There were a few hipsters in there, but my conservative suburbanite parents felt very comfortable in there as well.  

My only qualm was the lack of a menu and pricing.  If my friend hadn't recommended the Velvet I would've been totally clueless, and possibly disappointed.  While I was waiting in line I even pulled out my phone to check if their website had a menu, but couldn't find anything.  In the restaurant I could only find a list of teas (on a small piece of paper right by the register), and alcoholic beverages (on the glass wall).  Maybe I just wasn't looking in the right spot.

Food; Coffee & Tea,aRkYtXfmEKYG-eTDf_qUsw,Lux,461,4,3.27,3,"When planning my visit to Lux, I wanted to place an order.  Instead, I found myself thinking about the song, ""Confusion"" by New Order.

Their ""old"" location was too cramped, so moving next door was part of their natural progression.  The new space has plenty more square footage, but the layout of the rooms is a bit of a maze.  It's unclear precisely where to stand to place/wait for your order and there were cardboard boxes and other items all over the floor.  The decor has it's own unique charm with it's mismatched plates and furniture but the furniture pieces are placed so close to one another you practically need to jump over them.  That was a bit much.  What's Lux it trying to be?  Contemporary?  Retro?  It's hard to say.  Even the ""front door"" we walked in turned out to be a ""back"" door.  Why would they throw so much capital into the space without some semblance of clarity?

The food we ordered was OK.  I had a slice of quiche (pictured) which I believe had sun dried tomatoes, among other ingredients.  The counter person was friendly and offered to heat it for me.  My friend ordered two scrambled eggs, hash browns and two slices of bacon (pictured.)  We sat a a table in another room not knowing if a server would ever find us.  A server later brought the food over and left rather quickly; too soon for my friend to show the server the bacon which was just delivered was burned.  My friend gave me a look as if to say, ""How could the server NOT realize this is burned to a crisp?!?!""  So...my friend had to get up, return the bacon, wait for two more (precooked) slices to sit underneath the broiler a while and by the time she returned, both our breakfasts were cold.  I will say my friend was happy with her coffee and my iced latte was da bomb!

Lux may still be working out the kinks in their new locale.  Once they organize the boxes, furniture and service concerns, they'll be prepped for enlarging their clientele of repeat customers.  If I turn out to be one of them, the path to their small outdoor patio looks inviting and not at all confusing to find.  You may find me there sipping an iced latte and listening to New Order.",ltGh04bjEBhwItWVVG7UJg

The wi-fi is free and this is a great answer to those who are sick of the other chain places.

Food; Coffee & Tea,aRkYtXfmEKYG-eTDf_qUsw,Lux,461,4,4,3,"I usually feel a little uncomfortable walking in to Lux. Maybe its the way everyone momentarily glances up at you from their screens or their conversations when you walk in, seemingly sizing you up. Maybe its how free-form the space is, so that you're not sure where to stand when deciding on your order and you feel like you are in other peoples' way. Or maybe its the fact that almost all of the cozy, quiet spots are already taken when I go there, which results in wandering around awkwardly, coffee in hand, in search of a decent spot. I just can't focus on enjoying a cup of coffee when I feel so self-conscious.
One fantastic thing that I will say is that their cappucino art is amazing, although you may not get it based on who your barista is. One time they did some art on my hot cocoa, making it the best hot cocoa that I've ever had. And their pastries are pretty good too, although they can be hit or miss and sometimes I think I could make better cookies at home.

I live in Tempe and work in CenPho (@ Practical Art & Sack's Cafe), so I'm usually blipping in and out before work at the end of my commute, but I covet those few hours a week I can sneak away from everything, nestle up in a chic designer chair, and click away on my laptop (which--- outlets galore!-- I can actually plug in!).  On occaision, finding space to perch my bum can be a bit dodgy, and when it's chilly out their ample outdoor seating just isn't all that enticing-- but the times when I've been completely stymied have been few and far between.

I usually come here to study and truthfully it gets a little loud at times so bring earplugs or anything else to plug your ears with. And on weekends you may have trouble finding a seat cause the place is packed. This place needs more outlets and the wifi can be sketchy at times. That said though I have a lot of love for independent coffee shops this one included.

They make pretty good white hot chocolates here. If you get a chance try one of their italian creme sodas ( i like peach). However, good drinks is only half the battle for a coffee shop, the joint also needs good bakery goods. Now the great thing about Lux is that I am pretty sure they bake most if not all their goodies on the premises. Hence, sometimes when walking towards the bathroom area your nostrils are greeted with whiffs of deliciousness. (theres a joke in there somewhere) Their Mexican Tea Cookies are always a good bet, and are reasonably priced. What I also like about this place is that they have rewards cards which I made ample use of. The Baristas in general are pretty cool laid back folk.

So many coffee shops, so little time!  Finally made it to Lux and I was not disappointed!  I wasn't there to connect to wi-fi but if I had been well this is the place to go.  However I was there to meet a large group of people (enter shameless plug for said group here...Indie Music Meetup group) and I must say the outdoor seating was great.  Big picnic tables and benches ample enough to squeeze in all 12 of us.  Granted it is hot and humid this time of year and sure that wasn't great but that is no fault of Lux!  Upon entering inside I realized it is a pretty hip joint and by that I mean all the local hipsters hang there.  But all in all it was a good mix of people working on their laptops right down to our group of indie music fanatics.  Time to order some coffee and a snack; seeing as how it was later in the evening I ordered a iced decaf soy vanilla latte and a strawberry corn muffin.  I had ordered one of the muffins that didn't sell too many that day and since they don't like to throw things out I got another for free, can't beat that!  Well, if velvet had a taste I'm pretty sure that it would taste like the coffee I drank.  I am generally leery to try decaf as it never quite seems to taste the same or a lot of places don't put much thought in to decaf since ""who orders coffee without the caffeine?""

Their coffee prices are more than fair, $2 for a large coffee, and decent tasting. The biggest thing was not having to pay additional tax, as they have worked it into the prices.

A girl behind her told me that they make it different here, or whateves.  ugh, so I ended up with a slightly different drink then I had anticipated.  Slightly dissapointing!

Anyways, I dont know that I will be back anytime soon.  Why? Because this place was to small, to crowded and I would have no place to sit and and enjoy myself.

Everywhere I go I look for that special place that doesn't scream St#+%%cks and yet delivers great coffee with outstanding service. Here are my findings so far: Maui - Honolulu Coffee Co. Ann Arbor - The Common Cup, Ypsilanti - The Ugly Mug, Bellingham, WA - The Black Drop, Lettered Streets, Firehouse, and Tony's Coffee, Seattle (So Far) - Vivace Espresso and now in Phoenix - Lux Coffee Bar.

Upon entering the coffee bar you greeted with a smooth ultra urban vibe that is not pretentious, arrogant, nor fake. The service is outstanding, the bakery/deli products are amazing and delicious. The beans are hand roasted in the 'Employee Lounge' and are made into the perfect caramel shots poured into the perfectly stretched milk from a very talented barista. 

I know the LUX doesn't need one more review, but I must say that the cool vibe, the fantastic coffee, and the great spaces make for a coffee shop that I might just book a flight to Phoenix from Seattle to visit.

I heard they charge a cover if you don't bring a Mac.

All clientele jokes aside, this really is a place where an average Joe like myself can grab, well, an above-average cup of Joe. And more. This place has some apparently good eats, baked goods (some of which are vegan!), amazing teas, and a groovy beer selection.

I opted for an ""Earl Greyer"", because good black tea owns. This stuff was dank! The barista took the tiny pouch out of a can, and I could smell the bergamot from pretty far away. ""Let it steep"" he said, giving me about five minutes to scour Lux for this review. Here are some observations:

-I have excellent vision, but the menus printed on two windows were admittedly a pain to read. Sure you don't want to have some in print?

-The area to order and the area to wait seemed to be the same place. There is no clear line, but more of an amorphous bunch of people eager for service.

-The layout appears to encourage openness. Too bad most people are too busy typing away to enjoy what could really be a bustling social scene. Come on, there's amazing goodies, great music (I swear I heard some Band of Horses), and a bar. Live it up a little people!

-While the cooks were having a great time, I don't think my barista cracked a smile at any point. You have a great job. Enjoy it! 

Overall, I just have some minor beef with Lux's interior. A haphazard design that can easily confuse newcomers appears to be an avenue of pretentiousness rather than a chance to showcase aesthetics.

#1 - I once wondered where all the hipsters roamed in Phoenix. Then I went to Lux and I wondered no more. Pretty much everyone had an apple laptop here. Me and my vaio were the odd ones out. This is just an observation and has not a lot to do with the overall rating. 

#2 - It was crazy crowded in the middle of a weekday. The place itself isn't that big, so I assume there's a big following (confirmed by the number of reviews for this place). This made it difficult to lay my things out and have adequate study space. 

#3 - Smaller space + people = really narrow walk ways when people are standing in line to order.

#4 - Coffee is good, but not as strong as I personally like. 

With that said, the perks here are ambiance (fun art on the walls that I imagine are changed everyone once in awhile), good people watching, parking despite the amount of people here, and the fact that its by the light rail.

Since I obviously can't do that, I am always hoping that I can find a place locally that can re-create that nonchalant but cultured atmosphere so prevalent in European establishments and, of course, make some damn good espresso. 

Lux definitely gets some points for approximating the refined but casual feel of cafes and coffee shops in places like New York and Paris, and I very much appreciate places that remind us that eating and drinking are just as much an experience as they are about refueling quickly before we go off to our next daily task. However, because ""la dolce vita"" is not just about atmosphere but is also about taste and quality, I have to express my disappointment in the espresso we were served. It just wasn't that good. It was quite bitter, in fact, and it left a bit of a bad aftertaste in my mouth. I kind of expected more from the hype (and from the fact that I paid $2.50 for it). 

To be fair to Lux, I've been back since and the espresso and americanos were much better on my subsequent visits. In any event, it's always nice to take a break from the frenzied pace of life and to avoid the Starbucks drive-thrus as much as possible.",HOleI3jz1MLNUJ6cc1x0Pw

Despite what I said earlier, I'm really not knocking the food or coffee at this place. It's pretty good, but overpriced. In essence, you're paying more for the atmosphere of the place, so it makes sense. It's nice to find a place like this in Phoenix because I'd totally expect a coffeebar as such to be in Silverlake or Manhattan. Lux is a great place to read, share conversation, or just enjoy a hot cup of whatever. That being said, I'm not a die-hard fan of this place like some, but I enjoy stopping by every now and then.

Chances are if you're going to Lux you're one of two people: someone whose friend brought them along, or you want to look cool by going to a hip coffee shop.

Those who know me know I'm not trendy or a ""hipster"", but I've never had anyone at Lux ""scoff"" at my Target clothes or un-trendy shoes. And for the most part, everyone I know who goes to Lux really does work while they're there...they aren't just pretending to be on their computer! And if they aren't working, it's probably because the internet is down (which happens a lot more than it should at Lux). 

Overall, I really like this place but I can see how one who isn't super trendy or artsy might be intimidated when they first show up. My advice is to go again, a lot of different types of people go there and are really friendly. Plus, the different groups of people will come in cycles...at a certain time it might be inundated with twenty-something hippies with dreads, and another time it might be taken over by 30-something slightly overweight workaholics.

The food items i've had both baked and prepared freshly have all been adequate (the Mac n Cheese with bacon and Jalapeno was tasty, served in a large portion for the money and well executed but fire roasting the japapenos prior to adding them in would have elevated this dish to excellence!)

A mixture or modern and retro furniture, exposed beam ceilings, varied work spaces, and locally produced art are on par with and in my opinion rival similar concepts in NYC, Seattle or San Francisco.

I'd give Lux 4 stars if it were a bar that served food and happened to have coffee.

If your looking for great coffee i'd recommend Press Coffee Roasters, Cartel Coffee Lab or Echo Coffee. Lux is definitely my choice if you're looking for a place to socialize, sit and get a little work done, plow through homework or just hang out and people watch.  If the coffee were better i'd rate it 4 stars but as it stands, they only get the third from me because the whole package is so appealing.",cykCXyNrk3Xpo5ScViqA3w

Now don't go telling people my dirty little secret; but truthfully, coffee isn't really my 'cup of tea'. You know what is my cup of tea? Tea! and Earl Grey takes top billing. Earl really knows his tea, and Lux has that too. With a few minute walk, bike, or scooter ride from my front door to Lux, the wife and I like making this a frequent stop for a hot beverage or cold, people watching, dessert, or snack outing. 

While here, I wouldn't be surprised to see one of the top billed Yelping regulars, out of town coffee pilgrims, or Juan Valdez himself. I'm told by my buddies and my girl the coffee here is just that good.

Lux has a menu of fresh baked pastries, goodies, and other breakfasty items, like eggs, veggies, and bacon. There's also a full bar back there for those of you who venture past the coffee and pastry line. Careful though, 'cause Lux can get packed during morning, lunch and evening hours with most of the prime spots filled up already by gaggles of laptopians doing a work from ""home"" type of thing.

Now I've not personally worked from a coffee shop before, but I sometimes wonder how much 'work' is actually getting done. Maybe people just claim to work and are really just hanging out for the uber cool ambiance or the free wifi. I think Mr. Valdez did have is iPhone out the other day trying to connect up to the Yelp app. 

The walls here are spotted with local artistry that is on a seemingly endless rotation. Come back in a week or so and you might find something new hanging up there. If your a light rail fan, pop off at Campbell and Central and stop on in!

If you go during lunch time do not miss out on stopping next door at Pane Bianco for some of the best sandwiches in Phoenix.

Lux's pastries are good and they offer a verity of specialty bottled drinks. If you're a fan of iced tea try it with mango syrup - it's wonderful and not very many coffee shops I've been to have the mango syrup. It is my personal favorite. Also I love their soy velvet (a soy white mocha). Their smallest size is much smaller than average coffee shops - probably 8 ozs. But it's great if that's what you're looking for. All their lattes come with two shots of espresso, so you're only paying for more milk and syrup when you upsize, so buy according to how much you enjoy the flavor of espresso.

It was very hip, actually too hip for me, as I found the servers and the atmosphere very cold and unwelcoming...maybe even mean. Well, a lot of time passed, Lux changed buildings I think, and I was hearing great things about it from Claire F, who still lives in Phoenix. So ~12 years later, I gave it another try, and this time, it totally wowed me. 

It's still hip. Like super hip. But this time, everyone is friendly enough to make you feel really welcome. The furniture and decor are really eclectic and thrift-store cool. The crowd is pretty varied - on a Saturday night there were a few people too young to sit at the bar, mostly 25-35s, and a few 50+ sitting eating or reading or working on their laptops.

My favorite part of Lux is that it has a little section devoted to everything: a to-go counter for the bakery items; a more 'restaurant-y' area with bigger tables for ordering off the full dinner menu which varies nightly; a bar area where you can sit at the bar and converse with the bartenders or at smaller cocktail tables; a back room where you can watch a movie or chat; and a quiet room which has no music so you can utilize the free wifi.

We didn't eat dinner, but the menu looked interesting - the special that night was some kind of steak with veggies. We did have desserts (awesome, especially the salted chocolate chip cookie) and drinks (excellent beer list, and 'collaborative' cocktails. Seriously, you just talk to the bartender about what you like).

To top it all off, the walls are filled with the work of local artists, they have a big patio on Central (near the light rail!) and it's located next to Pane Bianco.

For the first time ever, I order my coffee and something sweet - for there. While in line, I eyed the sweets. I wasn't the only one, though. A little fly was having his fair share of sugar, flying from scone to muffin to cake. My heart dropped. Luckily, they had a few choices covered up in glass. I chose the massive, super-chocolate walnut brownie. 

Somehow, miraculously, I managed to carry two plates to the ""coffee condiment station."" I set the brownie down gingerly on the napkins. Then I balanced the coffee cup and saucer in my left hand.... while pouring cream slowly into the cup with my right. I made it almost to the door, when I decided to set the brownie plate down and sip the coffee below the rim - before it sloshed all over the place. It was a suspenseful, long walk and I didn't have a clue how I was going to turn the door handle and make it outside. I stepped aside and asked the people behind me to give me a hand. I don't think they heard me, but they held the door open long enough for me to slip outside... and into a wooden bench directly under the noon-hour sun. Wowza. 

Since it's always so hard to find a spot inside, I opted for out. My brownie began to melt. The hot coffee tasted great, but it did little to save me from the heat and the sweat beginning to collect down my spine. 

Needless to say, I tossed the coffee back like it was a cheap shot at a club, stuffed my brownie in the to-go bag I requested and practically jogged to my car, where I blasted the A/C and drove away.

I have to agree with Jason C. that the ""shift in employees"" is always hard to take, especially when you have had the same people helping to start your day, year after year. The new staff is pleasant though, some more than others...the nature of the hospitality industry. But I have noticed, however that the staff in the new barrista area are somewhat uptight ; I believe as a direct result of the confusion in the ordering area. It's a very odd setup. On any given day you can constantly hear patrons asking one another: ""Are you standing in line to order?"" ""Is this where we stand to order?"" ""I'm very confused, where do we order, and where do we go after we order?"" ""How do they expect us to get to the coffee condiments with so many people 'corraled' here?"" It's true, the ordering area is a 3-sided dead end. When the unnatural traffic patterns get out of hand, one of the cashiers will come out from behind the counter (table) and in a raised voice, try to herd the customers into some sort of line which never lasts more than a couple of minutes.
To add to the confusion, there is a nerve-wracking cross-pattern between the barristas and cashiers...3 of them have pointed out the numerous close-calls leading to spilled, hot beverages. Again, the traffic patterns seem to have been poorly thought out and arbitrary.
Nonetheless we are dealing with extremely talented and creative people, who despite the frustrating traffic patterns at the front of the house, continue to provide the best beverages and the most awesome baked goods.

I would marry Lux, but my life, my lover, my lady, is the the sea (ha ha, I got jokes). I've been going to Lux forever. Sometimes sporadically, but for the past year every Saturday except when I'm out of town, and when I'm out of town and it's Saturday, I miss this g*d*mn place. I went to a sushi place a month or so back and the server there recognized me from when she worked at Lux years ago. 

People mention the too-hip crowd, but I have to let you know that they're the kind of too-hip kids that used to be fat in high school. I've never had a bad experience with anyone here except the little kids who make faces at me or offer me their stuffed animals while I'm in line, those d*mn kids (jokes, again). There was, of course, one time this guy tried to take my place and mark it with his apple computer before I even got up from my seat, but I scolded him like a puppy (a strong ""NO!"") and told him he could have the seat when I decide to leave. You might think, ""well, if you don't recognize the too-hip kids, then you, too, must be a too-hip bastard,"" but let me tell you, I'm 31-going-on-65. My goal in life is to become a golden girl, I am currently really excited that there might be a concert band I can join, and my blood pressure goes over the top when I throw rocks into the ocean. Hip, I am not.

Mad props to the owner and his boisterous voice, Shadi (I don't know how to spell her name but she's there most Saturday mornings), the newish counter lady with the short red hair on Saturdays, the many rotating coffeemaking dudes, and the dude who sits in the corner on Sunday by the roaster room and plays music from a laptop over the speakers. There's also a coffeemaking dude at night whose name I don't know, but he's hilarious. You know it's been a rough day when I'm rolling in at 9:45 pm to get some caffeine, and this dude always makes me laugh. He's one of the too-hip people there with thick rimmed plastic frames.

I just realized I posted a review without reviewing the product. OY! The espresso is great. I've never experienced the drip coffee, but I've gotten various espresso drinks from cappuccinos to dolled-up espresso mochas. They're consistently fantastic. I can think of two occasions I didn't like the espresso, and they were both drinks in which I decided to go with soy milk. Every so often, I pull a hippy move and decide to try soy in coffee.

I'm new to Phoenix and had just about given up on trying to find a place to go and sit and work around creative people AND get good coffee while I'm there. As an academic, I've kind of built my life around working in good coffee shops. So when I moved here I figured I'd have to rethink all of that. Not so! Lux is my new fave. 

The coffee is real: espresso drinks are made by hand, not machine. I agree with others here that the beans aren't that great though. Even though it's not the absolute best coffee I've ever had (I'm a lifelong Peet's fan), it's certainly not reason to skip going here. 

On the other hand, the service is AMAZING. They remembered my name, made sure I got stamps on my frequent buyer card, and offered to heat my croissant in a REAL TOASTER and not some lameass microwave. I got a nice little pot of jam and a smear of real butter, too. They seemed to know I was new there, which indicates to me that they have a ton of regulars and make a sincere effort to get to know them.

There are plugs and free wifi and I don't feel pressured to leave before I'm ready. Lots of great people-watching, too. (Last time I was there, a woman in her mid-30s wearing a Slint t-shirt came in with her kid-- very cool.) There's nothing dirty about this place and I don't feel like I'm sitting in someone's basement, drinking coffee off of thrift store furniture. It's very much an adult coffee shop that encourages you to hang out for a while, either indoors or out. (FYI, there are nice benches and grassy spots around the building in addition to the tables under the awning out front.)

I only wish it were bigger, a little quieter, and much closer to where I live. I also wish it opened before 7 but that's just because I need something to make me want to get up earlier and get working. 

To be honest, since I moved to Phoenix 6 weeks ago I thought I was doomed to a life of grading my students' papers from any number of commercial or mediocre coffee shops. I have also had a hard time finding places to go where my people are at. You can imagine what a sigh of relief I expressed when I settled in with my cappuccino at Lux.

I met bonnie here pre-Chez Nous HH (that turned into evening since I got off work late) because my coffee shop connoisseur friend was posting up there until I got off work down the street. I admit I am directionally challenged to degree that is not only embarrassing, but debilitating. If you feel for me, take heed - I drove past it not once but two times. Add to that the light rail construction (it is right on central) and my post-work brain just about exploded. Poor bonnie had to take three calls from me before going out to the street to wave me in like an airplane.

But, once safely in the parking lot, there were ample spaces and I was surprised to see that pane bianco was right next door! Then it all made sense - why that phoenix cool-baby marketing rep asked me a date here, why so many people that I would not imagine know about these kinds of things seem to love talking about lux. It's right next door to prob one of the busiest/coolest places to pick up sandwiches for up-and-coming downtowners (uptowners?). 

Well, although bianco was long-closed, lux was happenin' at 7 at night. there was plenty of comfy seating (two couches, and easily 7 or 8 arm chairs) plus a long table seemingly designated for setting up laptops. The staff seemed friendly and nice, and I really liked that the shelves for placing flyers was inset into the counter where you order - still visible but not at all the messy eyesore they inevitably end up being.

Ok, now for my favorite part - the clipboards that hang on stings against the wall so that patrons can hang their own sketches, drawings, paintings - whatever. (miss bonnie herself added a RAD sketch of a sexy bunny-man, I suggest you check it out).

That being said, just because the food is delivered quickly doesn't mean its sub-par. It's ANYTHING but that.

It's generally crowded-- which makes sense, being as it is, in my humble opinion, the best coffee shop in Phoenix... maybe Arizona... maybe the US. Somehow the crowds and loud music never bother me-- and I can always find a seat.   Lux is one of those places that seems like it would be too hip for my taste-- everything about the decor, ambiance, and clientele suggests this, but for some reason, it still feels comfortable and friendly.  Maybe it's the warm embrace of out-of-this-world espresso and brioche.... whatever it is, it's a fantastically addicting way to start my weekend.",4d4xIM4lBG8BDZrG9pAuiQ

After moving downtown, Lux has become my new favorite coffee shop, breakfast spot, dessert spot and dinner spot. This place is ridiculously good. Their coffee is on spot and consistent throughout the day. Their egg sandwich is inexpensive (5$), yet super high quality. They actually make their food in *gasp* pans! No microwaves here. The egg sandwich is an over medium egg on an english muffin with cheese, bacon, and a roasted tomato. So good. Now, as good as that is, the biscuits and gravy are even better. This is what the BF gets for breakfast and what I eat off his plate when he's not looking :-P. The gravy has chunks of delicious sausage (and I don't generally care for sausage). The gravy is very well seasoned and full of flavor. Then, this week, we went to Lux for dinner. We had the bacon/jalapeno mac and cheese and the yorkshire pudding burger. The mac and cheese was creamy, spicy, salty and delicious. The burger was a knife and fork burger that had very flavorful meat (almost meatloaf ish) and a really good horseradish -y sauce. Finally, their desserts....I crave their desserts, especially their peanut butter brownie. That brownie is so awesome because it has the saltyness of the peanut butter and a rich and sweet chocolate flavor of the brownie....it's like magic. Brownies are never my first choice for a dessert....except here. This place continues to impress me and I will continue to frequent Lux at all hours of the day...",3gIfcQq5KxAegwCPXc83cQ

Kinda had me worried. dont really like talking to people unless they are authentic about it.

The place looks great, real industrial feel. lots of room and different decor which is probably by design. Variety of people too from tree huggers, businessman, moms with tots and a gay crowd. Pretty cool. 

Good coffee, very average scone. Great service. enjoyed hanging out for a couple of hours. Even saw the owner and he didnt approach anyone. He's hard not to notice. He's got the cool guy glasses and hipster pants on. Must have read some serious shakespeare that day.

I don't pretend to be an expert on coffeebars especially since I don't drink coffee, but after living up the street for this place for a few months and always seeing it packed when I'd drive by, I jumped at the chance to check it out when some friends were there earlier today.

I gotta be honest, this place was nuts.  I was confused upon arrival and had to look at my watch to check the time because I thought I'd just walked into a nightclub.  This place was PACKED.  I mean not a seat open at 5:00 on a Tuesday.  Music was blaring inside!  My boss called me from NYC and literally asked me if he was interrupting my bar time because it was so loud.

Anyways, loud (bad) music aside, I still had a good time.  The people watching was fantastic.  Such a wide variety.  I mean you had so many different angles covered.  You had your hipsters typing away on their laptops trying to look very important, the tortured artist at the table next to me feverishly writing in his journal, the section that I can only call the hairdresser's corner because all of their hair was immaculately coiffed and standing about 3 feet high, to my friends who were doing actual work at a table, sending out invoices believe it or not.

And then there was me, jaw gaping open the entire time, obnoxiously staring at everyone around me trying to get my bearings.

Since I did not eat or drink anything, I should probably point out that I will be returning to Lux for the people watching alone.  It was that good.  I'd imagine it would be mildly difficult for me to work here with the loud electronica music blaring in the background, but that's alright, I'm willing to sacrifice work for just a little while longer : )",1kED3-g-gqnc4JgHe89Xqw

There was a line, a long line,  which shows that Phoenix is desperate for a place like this.  They had a good selection of baked goods (quiche and pastries).  They have other items to order, but, according to the person taking our order, the menu changes and they did have one to look at.  She had to tell us what else there was to order.  This takes time and holds up the already long line.  If I was just stopping in and did not know to ask, I would not have ordered anything.  I ordered a mocha, the quiche and a scone.  They offered to heat up my quiche... mistake and I will get to that. 

The place to pay, pick up and fix up your coffee were in the same 5 or 6 foot square and with a line this long it got crowded quickly.  The other thing was that if you were not paying close attention you could miss you order.  They put the order out and call your name and that was it.  You then had to look over several drinks that look the same trying to sort out which is yours. 

My coffee came out quickly.  Then my scone a few minutes later... not sure why it took so long to get a baked good from a plate to the counter.  My quiche was warming and took much too long. I was with my wife's cousin and his made to order breakfast came out just as quick as my scone and the quiche was almost 10 minutes later, it was only luke warm.

The scone (lemon poppy seed) was a little bland.  The quiche was... well see above and was only so-so.  The coffee was fine, but nothing special.  They want you to bus your dishes, but don't label the place to put the dishes. 

They had a DJ for on a Friday morning was a bit much.  The music was also too loud for a morning coffee joint.

This was a place where people were working, reading and socializing... it is not a night club, even if it was jazz.

Another thing about the line... I actually saw several small groups leave after waiting too long.

The people who started Lux saw potential, but I don't think they know how to run a coffee shop.  Unfortunately this is the only true game in town and people are going to put up with this until someone opens the competition.",_czVhMtgTqM0BMT8VwocVg

The first time I went to this location I was instantly reminded of my favorite Portland coffee, stumptown. I love the fact that you can smell the coffee roasting as you get near. It just has a great vibe and has decorated in true minalmalist fashion (yes, lux, this is what it looks like) My favorite drink is the iced coffee, they put 2 shots of espresso in there, and I didn't even ask, Thank you!

Their coffee is house roasted off site and very good.  They have different varieties of coffee depending on the seasonality and availability.  They have a small selection of cookies and pastries but it's their tarts that set them apart from other places.  Their tarts are divine and luscious.  They also offer some unique cold beverages such as fresh agave lemonade and a variety of iced /hot teas.

For starters they have a great Blanco and Mocha coffee, with the best whip cream I've had (they flavor it with espresso). The vibe is hip and they feature rotating local art. 

The drawbacks for Lola are poorly designed seating and their breakfast menu. The room fills up artificially quick because most of the seating is occupied by one person while being designed for 2 or 4 people. Coming to Lola with another person or *gasp* more can be a problem if you want to sit together! Also, they have one of the worst omelets ever. Seriously. Denny's is better. They are not a restaurant, they are a coffee shop trying to expand their offerings- sadly it was done poorly. If you want a bite here, get a baked good- they won't blow you away but they won't remind you of the LOST finale (that's the omelet!). 

On a side note, the last time I went to Lola (about 2 months ago) I had the worst customer service experience of my life.

When it comes to my loyal patronage, I take everything personal.  Like visiting a shop on opening day and subsequently 2-4 x a week for months thereafter...I sorta expect at least one or two people to know my name considering they write it on a cup each time I order the same drink.  The honeymoon phase lasted a few months and Lola Tapas transfer Michelle was endearing and efficient.  But over time the romance began to fade.  

The coffee joined the pastry in the hit and miss category and the service became pretty unpredictable.  

The very last time my husband and I went we were SO excited to visit the new Roosevelt location and that experience became the deal-breaker.

I still drank it though, because the chick promised me it would help me feel better.. Guess what, I sneezed all night.

Thanks to Chef Danielle (formerly of Sweet Pea Bakery), Lola's baked goods are worth dreaming about. If you ever find macarons (perhaps this is the French spelling?), then you have to purchase one or two because those things are to die for.

I like the ambiance, I like the staff and people who frequent it. It's a good crowd, mostly on their laptops or busy reading their books or newspapers.

I'm a simple gal. I don't ask for those mocha, macchiato, extra foam, skinny-skinny, with drizzle and powder on top kinda drinks. I just want simple brewed coffee with some room for my cream.

The first time I purchased coffee at Lola's, it was served in a cup because I chose to drink it there. And it was already lukewarm, therefore, it was ""iced"" coffee by the time I had my second sip. The next time, I asked for it in a to-go cup, thinking that the lid might keep the coffee warmer longer. Alas, the drip coffee was lukewarm after my third sip. The last time I was there (3 days ago), I asked for them to put in a to-go cup again and to make it a little hotter than usual. Oh, it was hot alright, but maybe just 2 notches above their usual ""warm.""

I'm not looking for scalding coffee but just hot enough for me to enjoy hot coffee a little longer while reading the Arts section of the Arizona Republic (and there's really not much content in that section).

It is all one room, (even behind the counter) and neatly sectioned by the arrangement of the furniture rather than walls or building floorplan. This is an expert way of dealing with the existing design of the space, rather than tearing up floors and knocking down walls. Furthermore, the (from what I could tell) original ceiling support beams of the building were also left intact, painted, and incorporated as part of the overall design in a very elegant manner. 

All in all, I was very impressed at the interior design at Lola. Even though it's a bit like a Eurway showroom, everything is well placed and cohesive. 

Beyond the visual aesthetics, my coffee was great. I ordered just a plain latte, which was precisely what I was hoping for. There was an assortment of  pastries at the counter, which from what I understand are the work of Sweet Pea Bakery. I tried the cinnamon coffee cake, which was delicious. The crumble topping on the coffee cake was rich and crusty, and the cake was moist and tart, almost carrot cake-like. 

It's obvious that the baristas here are still trying to get in the groove of the flow of service and developing a system for taking orders/serving food/making drinks, etc. But this is definitely related to the place barely being open a week.

Daniel Wayne is no stranger to the coffee business. He has worked in Phoenix, studied in Italy, started a coffee business in Seattle and two in Phoenix. I really think he is has a superb palate, respect for tradition while not shunning the modern, and a great eye for style. He is also very humble and gracious. His roasting style shows evidence of having spent time in Italy: not afraid of caramelization and a clear focus on balance + complexity. Daniel is a fine barista and I always ask him to make my drink, if he is at the store.

Coffee culture is definitely apparent. From the espresso machine to the roaster seen clearly through a window in the seating area, it is a place serious about coffee without being overbearing.

The space is outstanding. First of all it is ""real place"". It was an old market, I think and has perfect light, due to its orientation, windows, and high ceiling. Daniel pulls together an eclectic assemblage of vintage chairs, drafting tables, a glass door for a menu, and an old school console stereo w giant dorm speakers. The elements work together to make a relaxing urban space. Daniel plays vinyl and we both are huge Cat Stevens fans. He played the ""Tea for the Tillerman"" album for me on my last visit, which made my day.

Not sure why they get slammed for service. I have always been treated well by all of the staff. They may not have the ""may I take your order, please"" smiley service attitude, but are respectful and kind.

Oh how I now regret not showing up an hour earlier!  I went back yesterday to experience what Lola had to offer.  I sooooo dug on this place!!  For me this place has some of what I miss about the Bay Area and Sacramento.  It's a great coffeehouse on a busy street in a vibrant part of the city.  I couldn't name all the cool tunes I heard playing over the audio system but I'm pretty sure there was some Depeche Mode (and I'm a product of the 80s/90s).  I had myself a double mocha with whipped cream.  The whipped cream was one of the best decisions I've made in a week.  You see, some dairy alchemist decided to infuse the whipped cream with some vanilla and espresso.  All I have to say about that is if the whipped cream spun it would be called DJ YummyTron!!!  So I sat down and chilled flipping through an interior design book with a forward by Joely Fisher and sipping on my mocha (I later moved on to reading an issue of NY Times Magazine talking about people who worry a lot).  I soon became distracted by the light-rail going by and a bunch of old cars roaring up and down the street (not gonna lie to you, there was some eye-candy of the femme variety in the place too).  I soon came to absolutely treasure the huge window fronting Central Ave.  Only downside was I don't have a laptop so I couldn't be one of the cool kids surfing the web while sipping my drink.  They had a woman come in and put together some floral arrangements which I thought was a nice touch (and I told them as much).  Go, sip, listen, watch, and enjoy!!!",TNkLN34v5aU1gku_0KLwXQ
Food; Coffee & Tea,WJ5mq4EiWYAA4Vif0xDfdg,Lola Coffee,107,4,4.69,5,"This is my review of the opening night:

I am a huge fan of the other Lola Coffee so when they said they were opening another location I knew I wanted to give it a try.  

I showed up pretty much right at 7pm on opening day Dec. 18 2009.  I went inside and asked if they were taking credit cards on opening night.  They said that they weren't charging on opening night which was very nice.  So I went and ordered my standard double-mocha.  While I was waiting I took in the visuals the new Lola has to offer.  This location seems to have a front of house that is smaller than the Central Ave. location however this is the opposite of a bad thing.  The slightly smaller size lends an intimacy to the place that is very inviting.  It has significantly higher ceilings and the hallway leading out the back door has two cozy and somewhat secluded tables (this would be great if you and your honey wanted to have some quality time together).  The decor is what I would classify as modern with some exposed structural elements in the front of the coffeehouse, a distressed table, and some nice metalwork.  You're also treated to the sight of a coffee bean roaster towards the back of the room.

I got my mocha and, since I was one of the first arrivals, had no problem finding a table (the distressed one).  As I sat sipping my drink and  perusing a book about the Great Barrier Reef I noticed that the place filled with people very quickly.  I ended up talking to an employee of Lola Coffee North (or LoNo as I call it now) for a while.  I then spoke to another woman associated with the business about some of Lola's green features.  It was then time for me to go so I retrieved my bicycle and headed to the nearby Central/Roosevelt light-rail station.

PS: the coffee was very good.",TNkLN34v5aU1gku_0KLwXQ

I've given it four chances now.

And I have to say, I am disappointed with Lola. I have been on the hunt for a chill coffeehouse in my neighborhood, where you can work and sip coffee, and occasionally chat with your neighbors. I live in right on Roosevelt Street and was hoping Lola would be that ... but it really lacks the ambiance I am looking for. The coffee was alright. The espresso shots tasted like they were burnt. The croissant I had was dried out. 

But the vibe is what was really lacking for me. I left after 45 minutes. I would rather be in my own house ... in my own space. I think the owner was in when I came in once and he didn't even make eye contact or greet customers ... nothing. I think that's why Lola is lacking an authentic vibe.

It is an intimate space, and the decor is nice, but being in there puts me in a bad mood. Too many wannabe hipsters and pretenders - and that includes the inappropriately dressed and overly tattooed baristas behind the counter. OK, you've got fake boobs, we see them already. I don't need to see them so intimately. You may also want to get a pair of jeans that fit so I don't have to see five inches of butt crack while you're getting my coffee. And dudes, having ink doesn't make you hip. Being able to be engaging and interesting makes you hip. And the sour looks don't help.

Lola is unpretentious, bright, beautiful, and fun--I'm absolutely enamored!

The space is open (not cluttered) with multiple options of seating...all comfortable without being slouchy and sinking.  The big windows allow natural light and the somehow simultaneously ornate and clean decor creates a perfect environment sit, work, relax.  A big counter covered with goodies (a basket of fruit, multiple trays of baked goods...mmm...) makes ordering a treat for the eyes (and a treat for the tastebuds if you choose to buy some goodies!). 

The bathroom.  You know, dear diary, how I am a sucker for a good bathroom.  Clean, single, big enough, proper placement of paper products, clean lines, nice, private--it's all I've ever wanted in a coffee shop bathroom!

Black tea...mmm...homemade chai tea...

I hope there will be many happy returns to dear lola...many happy returns.

Lots of love, diary,
XOXO

Christina

I really love coming to Lola. This location on Roosevelt, specifically. The layout, atmosphere. location, proficiency and friendliness of the staff...all have been in my experience vastly superior to the location on Central.. 

Diverse seating options, nice vibe, and of course - the coffee and baked goods! Quality local artisan roasted coffee - always organic fair trade beans. Baristas that know how to do it right. Try a Cafe Blanco (White Mocha) or the Matador. So good. Or just keep it real with an Americano. They do great cookies and other pastries, quiches, etc. 

This is a great place to get work done, hang out with a friend, or read the NYT on a lazy Sunday morning. I do all of the above here. Thanks, Lola.  I also really enjoy the local artists they feature here...nice touch and great finds!

 Not, like, a real city person walk. I mean a ""Phoenix, Arizona, this is totally walking distance from my office"" kind of situation. So, I am in heaven. 

That being said, I'm not sure I can see myself hanging out at Lola. It was sort of chilly inside (both temperature wise and general tone). But, I have been enjoying the coffee. 

The first time I went to Lola, I got their version of a white mocha - very very good.

Today I picked their drip coffee and asked for hazelnut flavoring to be added. I was pleasantly surprised that I was not charged extra for the hazelnut, that I ALMOST tipped the girl ... if only she would have smiled ... or made me feel remotely welcome. 

So, Lola could use some customer service spiffying up (based on other reviews I read as well), but it's not going to stop me from going there.

The coffee is okay and the staff are wonderful unlike the staff at the Central location who barely say a word but I would have to say on a honest opinion, no thank you.

The day I finally set foot in there I was pleasantly surprised and am happy to say Lola Coffee was beyond what I expected, and I was expecting it to be fabulous ;) 

The parking is easy to get in and out of, plus plus! There are two entry ways, one in the front and one in the back. The decor/ambiance of the coffee shop is awesomeness. It is a cluster of rustic, vintage and post modern. The people inside seemed like nice/interesting people reading their morning paper rituals over coffee. The shop is very clean, organized and ""pretty"". 

The barista and cashier were both very friendly and welcoming. Oh how I love when people making coffee have some extra enthusiasm that rubs off on me and sparks up a positive day for me :) 

The coffee was FRESH. The power of fresh coffee is beyond words :) They have all the essentials to making your own coffee to your preferences. They also have some not-so-ordinary pastries on display that look delicious. 

Overall, I am giving Lola Coffee five stars. I loved the location, the inner setting and the people that work there. Great service and a great commodity!

Food; Coffee & Tea,WJ5mq4EiWYAA4Vif0xDfdg,Lola Coffee,147,4,3.91,3,"Wow.  The reviews for this place are all over the place and I can pretty much see how they're all spot on.  This place is still in its infancy.  Some things are great.  Others not so good.  Depending on when you go your experience can go either way.  First, my bias is toward downtown and CenPho businesses.  The area where Lola Coffee is located is changing and, with a little luck, will be happing in the not-too-distant future.  I give a lot of credit to Lola's owners for picking the location and opening a new business in this market.  I want this place to succeed and will definitely give it another go.
My daughter and I visited Lola the first time twenty minutes before closing (7:00PM - a ridiculously early time for a coffee house but that's another issue).  Before ordering we were asked if we were aware they would be closing in twenty minutes.  Undeterred, we ordered a couple of lattes and took a seat at the very well done wooden bar facing Central Avenue.  The lattes were good, if a little cool, and the ambience of the entire place is pretty great.  It took me a while to get over the cool greeting by the staff but I began to warm to the place.  Hey, one of counter girls even asked us if everything was OK.  Things were looking up.
I visited Lola a second time by myself to get a coffee to go.  Service this time was much like the first time.  Hurried, frazzled (though there was no one behind me) and way too cool for this unsettling economy.  Now, I'm not expecting anyone to jump across the counter in gratitude but a smile and a simple ""thank you"" would go a long way toward giving this place another star.  
So here's my take on Lola.  I want it to succeed and will continue to go back.  The coffee (at least mine) was good.  I appreciated the pitcher of ice water on the bar (a la Lux?) and the overall decor.  BUT, in this weak economy I do expect the service to be ratcheted up A LOT.  Here's to hoping that will be the case.",mLfjeWUJnNiqHEye3I6qug
Food; Coffee & Tea,WJ5mq4EiWYAA4Vif0xDfdg,Lola Coffee,147,4,3.71,4,"The fur rugs can also turn into dogs, apparently.

As Kyle and I enjoyed our drinks (Iced Soy Mocha and Iced Latte) and yummies (Lemon Iced Cardemon Bundt Cake and Coffee Cake) on in a nook of living room furniture in a very appealing setting, I noticed random sheepskin rugs throughout the space and I saw a woman bearing a strong resembalance to Gloria Steinem hanging out reading Java with an oddly place rug to her side, and when she got up about a half hour later, it turned into a giant curly black poodle. This coffee may contain another ingredient.

Despite my hallucinations, this space is very inviting. I loved the rusted blue steel furniture and the creation of various spaces throughout this cafe. Mint green and chrome stools that face the street, various tables and chairs near the counter, three seats of sofas and chairs and a large conference style table near the entrance make a variety of meetings possible here.

While Lux is very chaotic, Lola is serene, not as high energy, it very much made me think it would serve an older crowd as well since I thought of many an older friend or mother I would like to bring here but my tatted up friends may prefer Lux. The music here was uneven and the serving style still being worked out, but hey-its the 1st week!

It also created a push for the pet store and Haus clothing store to get walk in traffic from me and my cohorts each I have been here, which I am sure is welcome since the light rail made many promises, but not much follow through.

Overall, my coffee was good, the pastries were fine, the food and coffee didn't really blow me away, but the ambiance was so good and I am excited to see the potential for another sophisticated place to relax outside of Lux in this area.",mfvezpz6ohS0NQk3DZdvqQ

The iced coffee is strong and perfect... no sugar needed! It's a blend of coffee and espresso, so maybe it's not the right drink for you if you're a frou-frou coffee kind of person. But you could always throw some syrup in it (if you want to ruin it... ;) ). And it goes perfectly with....

SCONES! Moist inside... crunchy outside... uber-buttery... perfection. They rotate the flavors daily, but all of the ones I've had have been wonderful. I dare you to find a better scone in Phoenix (and if you do, please let me know).

Given their lineage and proximity, comparisons between Lux and Lola and inevitable.

I find it slightly more relaxed and open -- the windows on the two sides create a light an airy atmosphere, and the layout feels less cluttered.

(A few notes: The folks that rated this place low must have been isolated incidences and I feel weigh far to heavy on service rather than product. Dining at a restaurant, rate the service a lil' harder, but a coffee shop, hold your tongue.)

Anyway, this place rocks. We aren't super close, but we pass up several coffee shops en route to Lola because the quality is top drawer.

The beans, fair trade, and the roast is perfect. The price of a bag of beans is amazing. Doing right by the farmers and then respecting the product with such a solid roast. This is what is all about!

I have yet to find a better americano. A splash of cream and a splenda only augments the flavor of the espresso and the richness really shines.

I must say, the coffee is delicious. I stopped by to have breakfast and caffeinate up before the Phoenix Comicon, and got the iced mocha. On a whim I decided to splurge on the whipped cream calories. 

O.M.G. That whipped cream had coffee in it. It was DELICIOUS. My boyfriend got his cafe caramel hot, and it came with latte art on it! (Silly, I know, but I've yet to experience latte art first hand). He loved the coffee. He described it as having notes of... peanut and chocolate? Or maybe it was another place's. Regardless, he's picky about his coffee and he loved it. 

We also got omelettes off the omelette bar. It's really quite simple, but they did it very well. I got mine with mushrooms and caramelized onions, and they went heavy on the fresh cracked pepper, which I love.

The decor in this place is pretty awesome. It's got raw exposed brick, concerete floors, an industrial vibe going on. I loved the reclaimed wood tables, and it's fun to see where they roast the beans, and to know that they roast their own. 

I don't live and work near this place, which I am somewhat grateful for. Otherwise, I'd be getting fat off of iced mochas with coffee whipped cream. That's not fun.",hIb1ikbIMI0t1EK4gPsK_A

Food; Coffee & Tea,WJ5mq4EiWYAA4Vif0xDfdg,Lola Coffee,107,4,3.42,1,"Ew.  All I can say is ew.   I want to preface this review with the concession that I have only been here three times.  I am going to harshly criticize the barrista I had on my last two visits, and I recognize that others may be better.  But she deserves to be mentioned, and I think that I am not the only one that had this problem.

Ok, so I went in on Labor Day. I get it, she wanted to be at home with her bestie drinking a margarita by the pool.  I would have preferred that myself, but I had a huge test on Tuesday morning, and I was using my day off to study.

I order a coffee.  I ask for a large Americano.  She puts a large paper cup in front of me and I ask her if I could have it in a ceramic cup, I'm staying and I don't want to use the resources.  She tells me that she doesn't have any clean cups.   I am the only one in line, so I tell her that I don't mind waiting, I will sit down and get situated, and she can wash one. She points to the room behind me, and tells me that it's Labor Day, she is alone in here and it's packed.

Ok, lady. I get it.  Full house.  But everyone is drinking their coffee, there is no crazy line at the counter.  There is no line at all at the counter. I can only assume that if you are out of cups, the very first thing you are going to do when I walk away is wash some.  I am letting you know that I am willing to wait. 

But I don't say this, I say, ""There are ceramic cups right behind you.""  ""Those are mediums,"" she says.  ""You ordered a large.""  She is really, really not getting the big picture.  I just want a damn coffee in a freaking ceramic cup, so I can feel civilized while not making a bigger carbon footprint in the process and study for my anatomy exam.

""That's fine"" I say, ""I will have it in a medium cup.""  She gives me a quarter back, which is apparently the difference between ad large and a medium.  Turns out choosing the medium cup was a mistake, apparently Lola bought her coffee cups based on style, not function.  They are ridiculously wide and shallow,. so it's kind of like moving a huge saucer to your lips trying to slosh some coffee into your face. I used about five napkins trying to wipe up the coffee that spilled all over the table (so much for not wasting paper) when I tried to set it down.  It tasted terrible, probably due to the horrible taste in my mouth left over from dealing with the barrista-from-hell.  

So after finally settling in, I realize that this is the worst place in the world to study. Or to sit, or to read, or to talk to someone.   Too tall, no sound absorbers, I can hear every single thing being said around me.   I don't know how to descibe it other than bad energy in there, kind of...uptight.  Like everyone else felt as uncomfortable as I did. 

I actually got up and left a full cup of coffee (minus what spilled).  The whole thing was just so bad, I wanted to get the hell out of there.    Even though it is right down the street from me, and it looks beautiful, I will never, ever go back in.",GVRWfB32i_zvIMJBfbvoBg

Their poppy seed and strawberry muffins are amazing as is their quiche, but it's their short bread cookies that are life altering. Ok that may be a slight exaggeration, but I suspect it's laced with something addictive because I think about them ALL the time.

Pop over whenever you're in the downtown area for better than the average breakfast, quick coffee or tea break, or evening chill session over the weekends. I enjoyed a solid slice of quiche last weekend; although it would have been out of the park with some spinach or veggie added to the recipe. They've also got a selection of pastries to grab, or omlets to order. The wife ordered an eggwhite omlet that was surprisingly yummy!

Heed this suggestion; skip IHOP, Denny's and Coco's and aim for Lola's at breakfast instead.You'll be glad you did.

Plenty of seating and it had a good atmosphere. It took 5 minutes for the girl to ask me what I wanted.

This review isn't about the WIFI. You also know they have coffee, since ""Coffee"" is in their name, and it's a café.  This review isn't about that either.

This is about the quiche.

Actually, it's about all the pastries, since they're all made by the same unfathomably talented pastry chef, but it's the quiche that, every time I have it, makes me wonder, ""If this is quiche, what's that stuff I ate every other time I ordered quiche?""  It's light. Just ... just so, so light, and fluffy. The crust is crispy and light and buttery. And it costs far less than inferior quiche at other places (about $4, I think).

But the five stars I gave it aren't just for the quiche, or the rest of the amazing pastries.  This place just does everything right: the location is in a beautiful, historic location; they have a terrific selection of loose-leaf tea; the atmosphere is cool, with worn concrete floors, a high ceiling, and vintage furniture; the staff is friendly, and acts like a family; and a vintage Bang & Olufsen stereo playing music that is far too cool for me to identify it.

Being that in Phoenix it was in the 70s, I was happy to be able to have the taste of spring in an iced Americano with two raw sugars. They make a damn good cup here, plus the barista is super nice, even when inundated with non drip coffee orders. 

I had to take it to go, but I loved the cozy, rustic environment.

You're like that ex-girlfriend one keeps going back to after the breakup is long past. You know the kind, the kind that keeps coming back begging for ""another"" second chance, saying she's sorry, saying she'll change, saying things will be different this time.  And you, you take her back again, not because you think this time will be different, but because deep down you're still in love with her and when you're together it's ""Oh-So-Good"".  But just about the time you really want her, really need her...Poof...She's gone.  Leaving you with another broken heart and lying there in a puddle of heartache and salty tears next to an empty bottle of John Daniels wondering when, no if, if you'll ever see her again.

Lola Coffee, I love you!  You're great!  You're amazing!  You're everything I'd ever want in a coffee shop; great coffee, amazing pastries, and awesome and friendly barista's.  If I were single and you were a girl, you'd be my type.  But there's just this one little thing we're going to have to fix if this relationship were to work.  You see, I need you to be OPEN when I want coffee.  I work during the day.  I'd love the stop in at 10:30 for a nice steaming cup of your morning brew.  But I work across town, and someone has to earn a living.  After work, I'm tired. I'm hungry.  I go home and have a nice dinner.  It's then around 8:30, or 9:00 that I'd love to come in and have a cup or two, snuggle up with a good book or my laptop and do what people do in coffee shops.  But every time I'm out and about and think about dropping by, you're CLOSED!  

If only you'd stay open until, say, 10:00 every night, I'm sure that with Hula's, and Maizie's next door, you'd have plenty of business to make it profitable.  Not to mention the fact that you'd make one, actually two, coffee lovers very happy.

-They always have great music playing.  
-Aside from their pastry case, they usually have some hot food you can order.

It was my first time there and I wasn't sure what I wanted but had been sent with drink orders from some friends. It started poorly. I stood at the counter for several minutes without a single person either before or after me and was not so much as greeted. I've worked in a cafe and that should just not ever happen. If they can greet you over the heads of 30 travelers at an airport Starbucks, I should at least be able to get a hello at a desolate cafe. 

Second, there was no tea on their menu so I finally asked the dude behind the counter about ordering I asked him about a tea order for my compadre. He looked at a paper behind the register, told me what I was looking for existed and rang me up for it. 

I guess my biggest complaint is the tone of condescension that was present from the time I opened the door to the time I left. Even the 4 middle-aged patrons looked at me like I wasn't trendy enough to be there.

Parking was tight, it could use more tables and chairs for people with laptops, and for a while it was too warm inside.

She barely answered us, then when we had to repeat the question she was nothing short of annoyed.  An example.  We asked where we could get a glass or cup of water.  She mumbled something about the bar/table.  My partner walked over and saw no cups.  She came back and asked where the cups were.  On the table came an exasperated retort.  I walked over to inspect for myself.  There were no cups on the table.  So I kindly asked her if the cups should be on the table, if so there appeared to be none.  She said they are on the table, but *sigh* I'll go check, but I know they're there!  10 seconds later she comes out of the kitchen with a tube of cups.  IMAGINE THAT the customer was right.

1- I really dig the Roosevelt area. Wasn't crowded at all on a Sunday afternoon and the surrounding buildings and palm trees make for a great leisurely walk with your coffee.
2- The service was great. The barista working was enjoying  a slower moment out on a bench with friends in front of the shop and as we arrived she got up immediately, greeted us kindly and told us she was going to go wash her hands before helping us and making our drinks. Having worked at a coffee joint myself once, I understand the slow times and the perks of helping a shift go by much easier when friends stop by and I'm glad she gets to hang out while understanding the importance of customer service. Go you barista lady!
3- The drinks were great! What more can you really ask for when you are purchasing a coffee. I got a large iced mocha with two shots instead of four (four would kill me) and my boyfriend got a medium iced latte. We are kind of coffee snobs and the drinks were wonderful. I normally order an iced toddy or an iced americano but was feeling rather indulgent that day.
4- The atmosphere was my style. Big open room, great tunes!, lots of places to sit to use your laptop, seating outside in front of the shop as well as great seating outdoors behind the shop and here's the kicker.. the bathrooms were clean and I didn't cringe or hold my breath while using it.

Went yesterday (third time) for a little of the old in and out, or in some circles known as a spot of coffee. Nice coffee shop, I didn't eat anything but had a lovely triple skinny vanilla latte and picked up a bag of their espresso. 

I love coffee art and my skinny vanilla latte had a touching and semi-inspiring flower shape on it. I immediately rushed home and scoured You tube to learn to make coffee art with my espresso machine. Oh, they make it look so easy, we tried it and are beginning to make progress, (I made the shape of an ink blot on my latte) oh to think some day my latte will have intricate bird shapes and strange Aztec images on our homemade espresso drinks, alas inspired by Lola's. 

PS. Coffee art is a lot harder than they make it look on You tube. 


To sum it up, I found it to be a nice caring touch that you don't see at many other coffee shops. 

The shop itself is really set up nicely and in perhaps one of the best central corridor locations possible. Off the light rail and in the heart of Cen Pho, it is strategically perfect. 

The down side you ask? 

The hours are Wimpy, Wimpy, Wimpy. One would expect later hours with a central-downtown-hip-urbane -Coffee shop of this caliber? 

I think the hours are indicative of an inherent conundrum to what ails Central Phoenix as a whole (although improving). Things are just not open late enough to be considered a World Class City. Hopefully, they will have longer hours as time goes on?

Food; Coffee & Tea,WJ5mq4EiWYAA4Vif0xDfdg,Lola Coffee,107,4,4.17,5,"Despite living near Fair Trade Cafe for 2 years, this has become MY coffee shop.  

Coffee:
The Matador is a great ""signature"" drink.  Their lattes are pretty good, if not typically as memorable as Giant Coffee's.  The Americano here is much better than other places nearby, in my experience.

Food:
Holy cow!  The baked goods are Lola are enough to make me skip breakfast and just head here.  I really dig the randomness of never knowing what they will make, and have never been disappointed when I've tried a new variation on something.  

Atmosphere & Service:
The atmosphere and the service are what makes me come here over any other coffee shop near Roosevelt.  Lisa and the rest of the staff have always given me excellent service, even when I show up at the last minute.  Great service, a greeting when I show up, and a personal touch make me feel much more welcome here than at other nearby places.  Plus, the lighting is great; I love to start my day off by grabbing coffee and catching up on the news/twitter from here, and I really dig the ""refurbished"" or ""repurposed"" feel to the furnishing here.  The school chairs, the well-worked white table, the door-as-a-menu, the exposed brick, and the great speakers in the corner all give the place a great, lived in, texture.

Shoot, I've mentioned this place 6 times on my blog in the last year (http://www.relevantwit.com/?s=lola).  I'm pretty clear I'm addicted.",6gSEyqsIboT-0Ap9ammKbw

Food; Coffee & Tea,WJ5mq4EiWYAA4Vif0xDfdg,Lola Coffee,147,4,3.19,4,"As someone who is originally from Seattle, I firmly believe there is no such thing as too many coffee shops (just too many Starbucks). The more coffee establishments in central Phoenix, the better for the rest of us. I've been to Lola nearly every weekend since they first opened, and I have to say that I'm a fan. I typically stick to a simple iced Americano coffee, so since I have not tried their other mixed beverages I can't comment. Their roast is rather strong (which I like), but some people who might prefer a milder roast should stick with something mixed with milk. Lola has a variety of small pastry, cookies, and granola food items, so while not a full-fledged café they still have a decent selection of bites. Prices on the coffee are in line with what you might pay at a Starbucks, so while Lola is not the least expensive coffee place, at least my money is supporting a local business and economy instead of Starbucks.

The venue is minimalist, but comfortable. The interior receives significant amounts of natural light due to the nearly floor to ceiling windows. The exterior area enjoys a small patio area with several tables and chairs. The WiFi is free and actually works, and there is plenty of power to plug in should one need it.

I have heard they are planning to open another location in downtown proper sometime later this winter. I'm not sure how I feel about that, to be honest. There is something to be said about an unique experience. If the owners plan to open another Lola, I hope they make the venue and experience distinct, rather than attempting to carbon copy the success of the original store and diluting the brand.",5G-6WKQ7VHcLsvRt6kqKvQ

The Matador (a cinnamon mocha) is as good as it gets - iced or hot.  I find myself craving them... and nothing else will substitute.  What send it absolutely over the edge though, is the topping of whipped cream.  Oh, this isn't just any old spray can whipped cream - this is a marvelous concoction of vanilla, espresso, and heavy cream... that just screams to be allowed to top a perfect cup o' joe... though sometimes they are a little stingy with the portion.  The pastries are also delicious.  I like the ever-changing variety and lovely displays.

Service - 3 stars
I am a sucker for the service at Luci's - where the baristas ask how your day is going, chat with you about what you are doing over the weekend, and generally try to engage you in any sort of conversation.  But, at Lola's, I've found the staff to be much quieter and reserved.  Maybe people like that?  But I definitely prefer a little more of a neighborhood-bar type feel.

Lots of olives and manchego, nothing else ever inspired (also I don't eat red meat/chicken, so is limiting).  

Not only did we have the best service in the 5 years I've lived in Phoenix, but the food was amazing, the atmosphere was still very intimate and romantic, and the true test - showing up at a restaurant 20 min before close- they passed with flying colors!  They didn't just welcome us, they encouraged us in, without appearing desperate.  We ordered all the waiter's recommendations (no chicken or red meat).  Gambas al pil-pil, garbanzo espinacas, Barcelona eggplant. I usually hate eggplant unless it's perfect.  Actually, same with shrimp, rarely is it cooked the right temperature.  EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT.  Much of this has to do with the knowledgeable, perfect timing and not hovering service from our waiter.  Wine was good, selection is fine. 
 
And my favorite part - the CHEF brought us out a complimentary desert because we complimented him on the perfect flavor of everything.  We felt so SPECIAL.  He explained that it was a chocolate cake made with olive oil and some other unusual ingredients (I couldn't focus at this point, I wanted to be staged and ready to eat quickly since I was sharing it with a person much larger than myself, i.e. my boyfriend).

This is where I was introduced to the concept of small bites to share among friends.  I really love this concept and was hoping I could find something like that in Phoenix.  Sure enough, we have something like that in Phoenix, and it even has a communal table.  Yay!

We met a couple friends here one night and were sat near the end of the communal table, but in a rather odd configuration because the party next to us was a group of three.  In any event we were handed menus and we got down to business in selecting our food.  This was a little while ago, so I don't remember too well what we got, but I will do my best.  We chose the Serrano Ham with Cheese, a Shrimp dish similar to scampi, a Filet Mignon dish, and something else that I just cannot remember.

I am a big fan of artisan meat and cheese plates, especially ones with manchego cheese.  There was enough food on the plate to give all of us a little something to try and whet our appetites a bit.  The shrimp dish was amazing.  The shrimp were perfectly cooked and sat in a pool of delicious garlicky-buttery goodness.  I wished there was more, but we all got a couple shrimp.  Finally, of what I remember, was the Filet Mignon dish.  I believe it was actually the special that night.  It was soooo decadent.  The meat was grilled to a beautiful medium and it was so tender you could almost cut it with a fork.  There were two cuts of meat served in this dish, so there was plenty to go around.  Everything was absolutely delicious.

If you are familiar with the concept of tapas and don't go in here with the mindset of traditional American dining (that you will be filled to the brim, pushing you past the point of gluttony) then you will love this place.  The communal table is lots of fun, and I guarantee you will meet someone new, especially if the alcohol is flowing.

Thankfully, our friends live nearby and I had been craving tapas and sangria for a while.  It is a tiny place (formerly a cigar shop) with a long communal table and a tiny espresso bar in the back.  Just like our first visit, the moment you walk in you definitely get a cool, neighborly vibe.

It was around 7:30pm and we had about a 20 minute wait, which was not bad since we were able to hang out in the back with our drinks.

We had an order of 1) chickpeas and wilted spinach (the broth that it is cooked in is very flavorful) 2) serrano ham with manchego and mahon cheese (my toes are curling with pleasure) 3) the filet (cooked to a nice juicy pink) 4) shrimp with garlic (the hands down favorite) 5) sautee'd portobello mushrooms (very good) and 6) the daily special of quince paste atop manchego cheese (good, but nothing ""special"").

In addition to the food, we all had one drink each, plus two pitchers of sangria (the best I have had in the Valley, I think), a coffee and two of their daily desserts (which was pot de creme).  For five people, it ended up being $34/person before tip.",vxUrKwxsGn3WwTsgkZJ-UA

That said, the servers used the space to lean in and take the orders of other patrons and I did get bumped once or twice. We had a pitcher of sangria (which was good, but I like Ticoz better) and 3 tapas: the asparagus (which was fine... nothing spectacular), the tortilla (which is like scalloped potatoes) and the flat iron steak which had a great mushroom topping. And, we had the chocolate apricot tart. The tart was the best part. Our bill came to $76 not counting tip.

Our server was warm, knowledgeable and welcoming.  

The food is TINY and amazingly delicious--Tapas, right?  well, I guess so--I just think every dish is probably about 10% priced over what each dish should be, 20% in some cases.  

But that Sangria (red) calls my name--If only, like my favorite place in San Diego, it had the pieces of fruit floating in the pitcher/glass...  Still, *by far* the best Sangria I've had locally--Unless I count my own.

Food; Coffee & Tea,WJ5mq4EiWYAA4Vif0xDfdg,Lola Coffee,69,3.5,3.77,3,"I can't help but feel the same sentiment as Nathan S. - I sort of feel bad giving this place only 3 stars with all the other rave reviews.
 
Let me start with the positives - 
 
I love love that the place is so small and intimate.  Especially in comparison to most Valley restaurants that are just cavernous.  And with the European-style seating you have to get friendly with your neighbors.  Both of these things make this feel like a good NY restaurant.
 
I also love the atmosphere and decor in general.  Very authentic Spanish, very laid back, not all hip and modern like most restaurants try to be these days.
 
The service was extremely friendly, from the hostess to all of the waiters and waitresses and bus boys that came by.
 
My husband really liked the Sangria (Tinto) - he said it wasn't very strong but tasted great.
 
Indeed, all of the food tasted very good.  Our two favorite dishes happened to be the daily specials - the Eggplant Barcelona and the Turkish Custard dessert.  But the Tortilla Patatas and the Gambas and the Spinach with Garbanzos were all great as well.
 
Now to the negatives - 
 
Firstly, selection was dreadful all around.  The wine list was very minimal, and the very limited bar didn't help.  And there were only about 8 dishes to choose from.  When I go for Tapas, the whole point is having a wide variety of small plates to choose from!
 
Every dish was DROWNED in oil.  Literally, bowls of oil.  The food just sat in my stomach afterwards, and I felt like I needed to take a shower to rid myself of all the grease.
 
The sizes of the dishes were very inconsistent.  I know it's tapas, and I love me some tapas, but generally at tapas places I find you could likely split each dish three ways.  The Gambas and the Spinach were both huge piles that could have been split up to 4 ways.  But then the Tortilla Patatas was barely large enough to split two ways, and then our two favorite dishes - the Eggplant Barcelona and the Turkish Custard - were both smaller than a deck of cards and splitting them just two ways left us each with a single forkful of food.  There was a party of 4 next to us that put in 1 order of the Pork Tenderloin and the waitress said, ""You should really get 2 or 3 orders of that so everyone can try some.""  3 orders for 4 people to try it?!
 
Then, right along with the food size is the price.  $90 (incl tip) for the 4 tapas mentioned above, plus a glass of sangria, 2 glasses of wine, the dessert, and an espresso.  2 of the tapas were one bite per person.  Yikes.
 
The food, while good, was nothing outstanding.  There was no dish that made me stop and say ""wow, now that is well done.""  They were solid but not amazing.  (As opposed to the Lomo Embuchado at Cobras y Matadors in LA that I was ready to marry and make babies with).

So all in all, I'd say a 3.5 star experience, rounded down because it just wasn't a 4 for me.  I can't help but compare this place to my favorite tapas place in the valley, Sol y Sombra in the DC Ranch, where they have a huge selection of fantastic wine (and a full bar) and a huge selection of delicious and much larger portioned tapas for the same price.",qASPib1Z8ft8e96dtbh66w

The first time I visited about 8 months ago I got a bit tipsy on the sangria, so go easy with that stuff. The problem was that it made me forget what I had eaten.

This time I was much better about the sangria consumption, just one glass. We did three dishes between the two of us, the Tortilla, the Spinach with Garbonzo beans, and the special that night of Eggplant layers.

The Tortilla is like a Quiche of Egg with Potato and is okay. The Eggplant was very good, but the winner of all was the Spinach and Garbonzo beans.

I have just recently in the last 4 months gone vegetarian/vegan and am saddened at times by the removal of Pork from my diet. When I started in on this dish I was concerned that I was violating my culinary discipline because the taste of Pork fat was very prevalent. Upon talking with one of the wait staff I learned that the magic ingredient was Smoked Paprika. Absolutely delicious!

That is IT.

So, anywho, we had people waiting for us who due to our large party of 9 people, went ahead and ordered one of every dish. Finding the place was easy enough off Cameback, we had a small private lot to the side, and we walked in, stunned by the dark ambiance, the dinner din and the sight of the cooks to our immediate left cookin' up food. We snaked back to a tall table (which I normally HATE, but I was fine with this one) that seated us all comfortably. We had some vegetarians (and the lonely lactose intolerant me), but most of the plates are seafood or veggie friendly, a perfect place for the vegetarian in your life (a really pleasant surprise). The asparagus was incredible and Stevey and I kept stealing extra stalks. I did try the shrimp, and it was just plain perfect, the sauce with garlic was impeccible. There was a soft cheese with fruit with brioche style bread that I thought was soft garlic at first-I did eat some (to some regrettable stomach problems later-but it was SO GOOD)-but that was a special that night so don't offer it regularly.  There was an eggplant dish that was savoury and not too oily. Damn, and some kind of infused olive oil with doughy soft bread slices. Oh, and plenty of olives, PLENTY-me and Jeff the other olive lover went ballistic-and we still didn't finish all of 'em....yuuummers.

Steve and I indulged in some simple (cheap) red wine by the glass, and the glass lasted through out dinner (we did two rounds of all the dishes) for like 7.50. Valerie had the sangria, which had a strong taste of strawberries (also had strawberries floating in the glass), and I found it refreshing, but didn't think it paired great with the savoury, warm tastes of the tapas. The bathroom was clean, nice. The service was friendly and down to earth-and we couldn't have done desert if we tried. We ended up doing 30 per person (including tip) on our cards, so for large groups this is a great deal for grazing, the conversation we could all hear each other despite the large size and the restaurant was cosy but not clausterphobic.

So close to the way my senora used to make it.  The grilled chicken with romesco sauce was just okay.  I loved the sauce, but the chicken was a little too burnt for my liking.
The real reason this place gets 3 stars is because of the jamon serrano and manchego.  The jamon serrano was chopped up, which is definitely a huge no-no is Spain.  You want the long strips of serrano ham to wrap around the cheese.  The manchego was warm and oily, and that was kind of a turn off as well.  Although the marcona almonds were a nice surprise.

We really really wanted to like it, but the whole experience just came up flat for us.

The intimacy and decor of Lola is great; it's not big enough where it will get very loud and the whole long tables to allow for community dining is nice. The color palatte was soothing and did not distract from the main focus which is the food. We were with a group of nine that evening, and from our perspective (not sure how our fellow diners felt), I thought service was spotty. Sometimes we would have to ask three times for something and it wasn't very crowded most of the time we were there. It was just like the waitress forgot. Apparently before we arrived, our group had ordered the olives which never materalized at the table; luckily we were not charged for them. Also, I really don't appreciate when waiters and waitresses cop a small attitude when you order a soda and not an alcoholic beverage. I know it's crazy, but even I don't want beer or wine with every meal!

I thought the food was the most disappointing part of the whole evening. The menu is pretty small, which surprises me for a tapas restaurant. Isn't the whole idea variety? Also, some of the dishes were good to share among four people, and others we had to really ration out the portions so that everyone who wanted a bite could have one. We also had to order four plates of the special since it was so popular with our table and to ensure everyone got at least one whole piece. I liked the tortilla espanola, but the one at Sol y Sombra is much better (and larger!). The special was also very good, but seriously how can  you go wrong with toasted baguette, goat cheese and onions? My husband tried the gambas (he likes the shrimp dish at Caffe Boa better), the steak and the pork and he said they were nothing special and were very unmemorable. My last complaint about the food is that there was no chicken dish at all on the menu!!! I'll admit I can be kinda of a picky eater, but even my husband commented on the lack of a chicken option for non-red meat or seafood eaters.

The other drink that they make here that is a perfect and refreshing summer drink is the Lolita, I love them.  I give four stars because there are many times that I want to go in the afternoon a little early to miss the crowd but they don't open until later (4 or 5) and when it is busy, the place is claustrophobically small.

And just when you think you have seen it all, one of the ladies that works there looks like a younger version of Mariska Hargitay from Law and order, where else can you go to get served by Mariska Hargitay?

Food; Coffee & Tea,WJ5mq4EiWYAA4Vif0xDfdg,Lola Coffee,69,3.5,3.72,3,"Lola is really a strange place. In some ways, it embodies a European sensibility--the communal dining, small menu, limited drink menu, rustic decor, and the uber-gracious hostess (who went out of her way to save a table for our large party when I called ahead) are all reminiscent of places I've been in Europe where dining is about simple flavors, good wine, and great conversation. Unfortunately, the portion size and unimpressive flavors of the tapas didn't quite live up to my expectations. After all, great atmosphere and sangria should enhance the food, not mask the fact that it's really overpriced and not that flavorful. 

Before you jump on me and tell me that tapas are supposed to be small portions, let me just go ahead and explain that I grew up in California where small plates restaurants are par for the course. I have absolutely no problem paying good money for a small plate that is really flavorful and is large enough for 2-3 people to get several bites of the dish. However, the plates at Lola were so small that in some cases, even after ordering 3 plates of a dish, someone in our party of 9 didn't even get one bite! The most laughable example was the gambas dish. The plate came with 4-5 tiny shrimp for $10 bucks or so! For $2 per shrimp (not even prawn!), we just gave up trying to order enough for everyone to have a solidly sized portion. The asparagus dish was similarly amusing - one $8 plate contained about 8 baby asparagus stalks. And when I say baby, I mean it. These suckers were like pinky sized!

I would have had a little more patience for the portion sizes (which already made me want to go down a burger after we left) if the flavors were brighter and more memorable, but that aspect of our meal was also a letdown. The daily special (bruschetta-like pieces of bread with caramelized onions, honey, and goat cheese) was very enjoyable and I thought the filet was tender (although kind of bland), but the pork tenderloin, gambas, and eggplant were completely uninspired. I thought the eggplant tasted like soggy eggplant parmesan and failed to see what made it Spanish. The tortilla espanola was the best dish by far but still fell a little short compared to the one at Sol y Sombra. 

Lest you think our experience at Lola was horrible, I want to remind you that I loved the cozy, rustic environment and that the hostess made the experience of showing up with a party of 9 at a place with communal seating a bit less stressful. Furthermore, I thought that the red sangria was really good (strong without being too sweet) and the pitcher was a pretty generous size for the price. I just can't get too thrilled about a place where the food--the crowning glory of any great European restaurant--isn't that flavorful and isn't generously enough portioned to allow everyone in the group to really share in the flavor experience.

The atmosphere is very pretentious considering this place is pretty much in the middle of the barrio... The seating inside is horrible.... It is one big long table and everyone gets seated next to each other. I was deeply immersed in the conversations of the groups to my left and my right.  The group on my right were going to watch a show after dinner and the group on my left just got back from a trip and they were meeting up with a friend for Vietnam. I made up stories about getting a sex change operation just to mess with everyone because if I heard them then sure as hell heard me. 

I went here with my mom after we visited the Botanical Gardens. The outside looks like it could be a local dive bar... When you go in everything is dark... I hated it... The kitchen is open so you see them cooking the food and you can hear all the dishes making noise. The clientèle seemed like they were more middle-upper class but they were all weirdos... It is one thing to watch the Real Housewives of Orange County but you can't pretend to be the Real Housewives of Orange County.

Thank God the sangrias are good. They get 1 star for their sangrias... the other star was for the flavor of the food. It was good... I really like the Paella... They did not get anymore stars because the server got our order wrong and failed to bring us one of the dishes we ordered. Oh and she gave us bread with olive oil... No balsamic vinegar... I had to ask for it... WTF???  Did I mention how she made us feel like we did not belong there... Excuse me miss I work for tips. You messed with the wrong Diva today!!! So I ended tipping her $1.00... on a $90 bill. My mom was embarrassed but I am not running for Mrs. Congeniality so be glad I even left a tip. *Evil Laugh* 

Oh and they do not have diet coke... WTF? It is 2010... Doesn't every place have a diet soda.  They said they have Lemon Aid.... Um... Diet Soda is not Lemon Aid. Another WTF moment!

Also one last thing to bag on them about... The waitress told us they had specials but when we read the menu the specials were just the same thing. I even asked if there was something different and she said no. To this day I wonder what made them special if they were part of the regular menu.

BTW this place is all tapas so everything is on little plates. Not sure why people are surprised.  That is a given considering the name of the place. Price was in-line with the quality of the food.... don' get me started on the service though.  I am now taking away 1 of the 2 stars I gave them just because I had to think about the service we got and it still leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. 

I hope you have a better experience at this place and less ""WTF"" moments. LOL",f2aH-hqBtQLMGegUsJvi9g

We were left pretty much standing and ignored for awhile and finally I said forget it let`s just go to another place which we ended up at Barrio Cafe. I called ahead to that place and no regrets going there instead!

I wish I could rate a 3.8 for this meal.

Primarily for 2 reasons:
1)  No Patatas Bravas???
I spent 2 weeks in Spain and at Patatas Bravas EVERY DAY~
2)  Lack of  a more full bar.
Although Vino Tinto is a very Spanish drink.

The menu is a wee bit limited.
However, the Tortilla (Spanish) was great, as was the Puerco a la plancha, Garbanzos and Spinach was tasty.  The Jamon and Sarrano was good, but maybe too much ""Antipasto"" style for me.

The Pot-de-Creme was very very rich and thick.
I personally like a more ""mousseY"" pot-du-creme.
Personal preference.

Service was excellent; quick , accurate and cheerful.
Drinks were great, ambiance perfect.

Highly recommended (expecially once they have Patatas Bravas back).

Food; Coffee & Tea,WJ5mq4EiWYAA4Vif0xDfdg,Lola Coffee,69,3.5,3.42,3,"Where's the rest of it?

The restaurant is small... not just that it's small though. Lots of places are small. This place just FEELS extra small. Compact isn't the best word, but it's the first that comes to mind. Crowded and Cramped are two more words. 

It's a cute place. It's nice inside, and looks pretty hip and contemporary. It's clean too. They have an outside patio where you can wait for your seat to open up, but it doesn't seem like they're maximizing the space out there very well. 

It was awkward trying to get a drink while you wait outside. Servers and staff seem to have worked out a system of touching people to get around them. They're used to the crowd, so they must be kinda grabby I guess. At least they were polite about it, but I still felt a bit violated and molested... but not in a bad way. 

The wait wasn't as long as they had predicted, but they left us waiting for our empty seats a good 15 minutes after they were ready. We sat at the big family style table and snacked on bread while we waited to order. The bread was artisan style and it came sliced with a some flavorless oil to dip it in. It was okay. If you like to rub elbows with strangers, this is the place to go. 

The stools were comfy for stools, though the fact they lacked back support wasn't working for me (I have a bad back). There's nothing to dampen or absorb the sound in this place (tin ceiling tiles even), so it's difficult to hold a conversation with your friends or hear yourself think.

We ordered 4 dishes to split between the 3 of us. Steak, shrimp, pork, and one of their bean-based specials. I didn't try the bean, bacon and sausage thing as I'm not a fan of beans. It looked like dog food though, and I didn't see it being worth the price. I had some of everything else though, and I pretty much enjoyed it. 

The steak was just strips of steak with some flavorless drizzle on top... cooked well though, and tasted good. The pork was good, but maybe a little dry. The shrimp was tasty, but very oily nothing you couldn't get at Smart and Final's frozen food section and cook up yourself. I had to take the tails off myself - I didn't mind, but at these prices, c'mon. 

That was it - something was missing... Cheese? Veggies? I don't know - it just didn't seem like we got much worth for the money. I can't really complain about the money though since my friend paid for the whole thing. I didn't get a drink, but I tasted my friend's Sangria... it was okay. I haven't ever had this kind of food before. It's definitely something I would eat again - I might even come back to this location on a less busy night.

Service was good, place was cute, food was decent. I just wasn't blown away.",Cp-PV8rsypbO-xBrQ6KmQg

My friend Rayna was nice to give this place 2 stars, but I can't even do that.  I was so disppointed by the whole experience, especially since I was looking forward to my first Tapas experience ever.  I was over the moon excited, but the service was such a let down, I don't think I would ever give it a second chance.

I am not trying to be Ms. Whinypants here. I understand the whole sitting with others at the table concept.  When my two friends and I showed up for my friend's birthday party, we were greeted right away.  We said that we had a party of 6 and they will be there in less than 5 minutes.  The hostess explained that we could sit at the bar and wait, but she couldn't seat us until our whole party arrived.  She did point out that there was seating for 6 people and she was going to reserve it for us, but she couldn't hold it until the whole party arrived.

Well, while we were waiting, a couple walked in and asked to be seated.  There were other places for them to be seated....but she chose to seat them at our ""reserved"" spot.  After that, while we were still standing there, she ignored us.  Didn't explain to us that she had to seat them there or anything.  We were just completely ignored.  Even when she noticed that another person in our party arrived. An explanation would have been nice. 


We thought it was unprofessional and lost the customer service appeal altogher.  We felt like she chose 2 people or 6.

What isn't cool is the volume inside Lola. I am a big fan of the communal tables, but they are too wide, it's very hard to hear the person across the table that you are with. This is mainly due to an echoing room and music that is too loud.

I somehow feel the need to appologize for the lack of stars to all of you who seem to love this place. I would certainly be willing to give it another try but I was not impressed.

First the music is loud, and therefore everyone talking in the place turns up the volume and as my girlfriend and I were seated across from each other at the communal table we could barely reach to share the food let alone hear each other.

Why are the tables so big if the food is so small? Maybe I am a bit of a glutton, but for 8 dollars I essentially ate a mushroom for dinner...Don't get me wrong it was tasty, and I understand Tapas are appetizers, but 8 dollars? I was disapointed. I used to go to Firefly in Vegas and it was cheaper and tastier.

We just wanted to try this place and move on someplace quieter, but I was really looking forward to it...We decided not to have drinks and simply share one thing so we could get to said quieter place before it got too late...I think because we ordered so little, the waitress considered us a waste as far as her tips were concerned and therefore seemed not so friendly...and those little bitty glasses of water they bring...I drank immediately and it was never refilled.

The chicken and the mushrooms are both thumbs down.  The chicken was dry and bland, and the mushrooms tasted like the ones in the grocery store that come in a glass jar, i.e. not fresh.

Or maybe I just love simple and delicious food. 

Lola Tapas offers a limited menu that consists of favorites from Spain. The last time I was there myself and two pals had about 6 plates and a sangria for about 30 bucks each (that included tip). Is it pricey? Yes, but it is also well made and delicious. I highly recommend the fillet and and the tortilla de patatas. Do not go to Lola expecting Mexican dishes. An example is the tortilla is not a masa based flat bread. It's actually more of an omelet but not as ""eggy"". Just try it. You will be so glad you did. The ingredients are so fresh and well crafted, that it's hard to mess up here.

Our waiter was very friendly and quick. He even recognized me from my first visit. Any of the servers are there to help you so don't be afraid to ask any one of them for something. They all share gratuity so everyone is glad to help where they can.

I planned visiting one of the coffee houses within a 5 mile radius but my lack of familiarity with Mesa made that a disagreeable prospect. Fortunately, I noticed Lo-Fi Coffee, which was literally part of the concert venue building, before I began my trek. Lo-Fi was a comfortable place that served good coffee. But what made me a fan of Lo-Fi was the barista, an Air force vet who was friendly and went out of his way to make me comfortable (they closed at 9 and he let me sit in  until 9:30 - concert lasted until midnight).

I got the iced coffee / toddy. To be honest the iced coffee was pretty good. Not diluted and not overpowering.  It is a very standard coffee shop layout. It has a good study layout, but the room sound travels too easily and if you are a study in the quiet type person it isn't going to work for you.

To address the price, it is about the same as other places, their prices include tax so that is always nice. You only need quarters when you go here. Very convenient

The staff is chill, definitely a nice place to come by if you live around here. (which i dont)

The only thing which is dumb is the parking time limits, but that is the city's fault.

Why doesn't this place get 5 stars you ask?

They really don't have anything to make this a unique destination, it is just plainly a coffee shop with out a specialty type drink they overly excel at.

I went in and asked if they had a specialty type drink they are known for...i was told the toddy with soy. Needless to say, it was good but didnt blow me away to be a specialty of theirs.

When I walked in, it had somewhat a strange smell.  I don't know what to make of it.  Like an old second hand store mixed with coffee.   I was surprised the there were only a couple in there when the rest of the shops and streets were bustling with people.

My little cutie pie ordered a strawberry Italian soda.  The barista, quick thinking, used strawberry puree instead of the usual flavored syrup he didn't have.  I love that he made my son happy as a clam.  My hubby couldn't quite make up his mind and was talked into an espresso macchiato.  I warned him that he never liked espresso.  But, he listened to the barista's raving about how it was the drink that sealed the deal for him to like coffee.  Hubby did not want to hurt the guy's feelings, so he tried it.  I knew he didn't like it when he made the ""bitter beer face"" after each sip.  I had the Americano with cream.  Soy and almond milk are each .50 cents extra.   I love that they use local coffee roaster company.  We didn't try any of the baked goods.  It just didn't look interesting enough.

This place has been my favorite coffee shop in the East Valley for a quick coffee for years. Used to hit the drive thru for a ""nutty cow"" and bagel with cream cheese on my way to early classes or work shifts. They don't mess around with their cream cheese, you get your money's worth. Alas I moved to another part of town and am not as close to them anymore and can't justify driving 10 miles out of my way just to get a coffee. But when in Gilbert, I will stop in whenever I can.
Lately I've rediscovered my love of a good quick coffee from a place that doesn't burn their espresso(desperate times called for desperate measures) and I stumbled upon their little gem called a Rocket Latte. This thing is small but it packs a punch. It tastes like a strong coffee, I get mine with a couple raw sugars, but it is as much caffeine as you could possibly need. 
I have never had a negative customer service experience here. Whether in the drive thru or going in to snag a comfy armchair to do some paperwork or chat with a friend, I have always been greeted with a smile and a great attitude.

I have been missing out!!

When I walked in at 2pm, all the tables were full but there was no line at the counter. The cheerful barista asked what she could get for me and when I said I wasn't sure, she not only told me to take my time, but pulled out laminated sheets listing their syrups and teas. That intuitive customer service set things off right from the get-go. I noticed they had one of my favorite (yet hard to come-by) flavors- praline, and ordered a decaf iced praline latte. The barista made the drink quickly, in spite of her accidental initial pull of regular espresso, which she noticed right away and fixed. She also asked my milk preference which I liked because let's face it girls, some days are skim days and others are 2% days and it helps to have someone remind me of that. :)

The latte was satisfying. It wasn't mind-blowing, but it was made well and wasn't overwhelmingly sweet like the lattes they usually serve at Starbucks (this coming from a sugar fanatic!). The pitcher of water and water cups they have out with the cream and sugar is a nice touch that I'd like to see in every coffee shop. 

The decor is sort of rustic with burlap coffee sacks above the door and local art on the walls. The atmosphere, which can't really be pinned down to one thing, is welcoming and relaxed and I felt like I could hide away for hours there. 

There were a few negatives. The first was the mess of a baked goods display. I'm sure it looked great at opening, but by the time I was there, it was disheveled, half empty and didn't look like it had been tidied up all day. Typically I ignore the food offerings at coffee-shops, but I skipped lunch today and could have been persuaded to drop a few dollars if I'd seen anything remotely interesting. The other thing is that they have a drink refrigerator containing water bottles, juices and other bottled drinks for sale. It's so loud!! It cycles on and off, but when it's on, it can be pretty distracting. 

I will definitely come back to this place, especially as the weather improves and all the outdoor seating becomes a viable option. Now I just need to silence those evil thoughts that tell me it's acceptable to get a gelato within the same hour as getting a sugary latte...",WsA0NtJVRIqlmBXsYAhgWA

Hava java stopped inviting & welcoming customers when it started putting offensive signs on the bathroom door, and then password protecting its free WiFi service with passwords like BUY COFFEE!

A couple nights ago, we stopped in at Hava Java for a caffeinated beverage before enjoying some gelato next door.  Being the afternoon of July 4th, the place was empty, save for the barista and a guy who was in there chatting her up.  I ordered a cafe au lait, he an iced coffee of some sort.  After asking me if I preferred skim milk or 2%, the barista handed me my cup of milk and foam and told me the coffee was self-serve and pointed me in the direction of the three coffee dispensers on the other side of the bar.  Really?  $3.75 for a cafe au lait and I have to pour the coffee myself?  I suppose that wouldn't have been entirely terrible if it had been any good.  It's amazing how much difference whole milk makes, but even beyond that, the coffee was weak and flavorless, and since it had to be pumped over the weak foam and milk, my drink tasted like little more than a drip coffee with milk.  Lame.  Sorry, Hava Java - a repeat customer I will not become.

What she handed me was A CUP OF ICE with two BITTER, BITTER, BITTER shots of espresso in the bottom. (That's not me being hyperbolic. I came home and made everyone in the house try the most bitter coffee concoction I've ever come across.) Okay so then she sent me over to the bar to the hot coffee. Melted my ice and my plastic cup. Not exactly what I meant when I asked if they had iced coffee... 

How much did this crud cost me?? A whooping $2.75. Oh, but wait! It's actually $3.00, an extra 25 cents for running it on my card, which she tells me AS SHE SWIPES MY CARD. I had cash on me. And I really would have preferred to be offered a choice to use it ahead of time. 

Also, their seating consists mostly of a long bar against the wall opposite of the coffee counter. You wouldn't be able to camp out here with a laptop, homework, or even a book. There just isn't any room. There's a few tables, but if a group walked in you'd have a major guilt trip.

My, what lofty praise, I think. Is this place really the best? Hmmm. 

After forking over $2.75 for a double shot of espresso, I made my way to the coffee bar where there was cold skim milk, plenty of sugar packs and a variety of flavor-adds, like cocoa. Then, I took my first sip. Yum. Of course, can you really mess up a double shot of espresso? God, I hope not. 

In any case, this place is ""nifty."" I use that word because it's situated next door to The Gelato Spot and is a bit crammed for space. A splattering of like 4 people at the tables near the door made this place look a bit too crowded to me. Then again, if I had been at one of those tables, I probably wouldn't have noticed, or even cared. 

The girl behind the counter was very friendly. I appreciated that. It's not often I joke around with baristas. She managed to make me laugh, too. To me, that's sweeter than an extra pack of Splenda. 

Hava Java is a great location. I wondered over here after stuffing my belly full of wonderful sushi at Zen 32. My cohorts were immediately pulled into The Gelato Spot while I ordered my beverage. 66% of 'em wound up with gelato. Having already ordered and flavored my double to taste, I went hunting for them. That's where I found 2 of them cozied up to gelato and another teasing herself with the idea. I sampled a couple, but was very content with my coffee. So, if you plan to drop by Hava Java, just make sure you walk right up to the counter and order, or you may be sucked next door where you'll succumb to your sweet tooth. 

Then again, if gelato isn't your thing, I did see ridiciously huge muffins and bagels on display at Hava Java. They looked ridiciously delicious. I don't know why anyone would need a muffin the size of King Kong's fist. But, then again, I couldn't resist the after-lunch pick-me-up that Hava Java delivered.

2.) They roast their OWN beans. That's right. They wheel a roaster out onto the same concrete slab that becomes the stage for Valley blues legends like Ronnie Whitehead on 2nd Saturdays and roast the beans for themselves!! I find their coffees to be pretty earthy and smooth. 

3.) The fudgy pecan brownies are rich and chocolaty. The scones are biscuit-like and just the right amount of barely sweet. (I haven't tried the danish, but they look deadly!)

4.) They are generous in sharing their own talents and promoting the talents of others, ensuring access to arts and culture. Each month, they allow a different local artist to show their work on the coffee shop walls. And while ordinarily they are not open past 6 p.m. on Saturday, an exception is made on the 2nd Saturday of each month when you can sit outside and listen to  live jazz and/or blues from 8 - 10 p.m.  And, by the way, Dennis, the owner, is a bad ass on the harmonica! 

We really are so lucky to have such a great business, doing great things, in the community!",vsXP832M0kOxKpfduD7dWw

However, it has been nearly a year and the only coffee item I have tried is the Viennese. Am I really just a creature of habit, or is this coffee filled with nicotine? It's delicious, anyway. Get it! 

I like the names of their sizes, it's cute and I take it as a jab at Starbucks, which pleases me immensely. The atmosphere is very ""living room"", with local art they sell to customers, comfy couches, and tables that have seen lots of use. Their patio is getting nicer now that it's cooling off, and usually the baristas if they aren't too busy will walk your coffee or drink of choice out to you. 
They roast their own beans, and sell them to you in cute little paper bags! Mum loves the Heavenly Bliss, it's not too acidic like some roasts are, and has an amazing aroma when it's going through the coffee machine, plus it isn't too pricey for in-house roasted beans, which can often get expensive.
I live close enough to hear their live bands play when I'm out and about, and they're usually good falling in to the Blues category, A few friends say it's definitely worth the trip over there to check it out!",vG8e2d_hxqpu2fW68kTESw

Pros - The coffee is pretty good, it's locally owned, there are recurrent characters every morning no matter what, and their support of other local business and artists is commendable.  

Cons - For some reason I never get a very friendly vibe when I'm there, the facility is kind of small and I feel like it lacks character, and...it just lacks that little extra.

We'll see, maybe I'm tarnished by the fact that I stop in here before work every morning and it's ME that isn't in a friendly mood.  Then I just thought about my review for D-Lish in Scottsdale....",mQba83gB018LlGt51r80ZQ

Plenty of parking.  Located on the southeast corner of Central and Dunlap.  The coffee is great, the seating is comfortable and the people are very nice.

the espresso was bitter.  i paid $3.00 for 3 shots.  i added my sugar and half and half at the some what dirty side bar (mostly drips and sugar crystals about, but dried liquid, so it had been there a while).

about 3 sips into the drink, i got a huge clot of half and half that must have fallen into my cup from the container as i poured it.  i couldn't bring myself to drink much more, i took the lid off and sipped it, but it was not that great, so i threw it away.

I got a Grande Latte that was around $4. Not a bad price. But what made it worth it was that I guess this Friday I went was a Free Shot Friday. So I got an extra Espresso shot in my latte making it a triple for $4 bucks...no that is a deal. Not sure if they always have the promotion on Fridays. But it sure did make my morning a little better.

Their menu is very easy to read and give those no too educated in the was of coffee a good description of what each drink is and how it is made.

The had a ton of great looking pastries even though I didn't sample any. Cakes, Eclairs, Scones, and I think even what looked like cheesecake. 

The decor was very interesting. An old fashion coffee house meets a gypsy vibe. I think they have Wifi too. I saw a few people on there computers.

The service was a little slow I think. Felt like I was waiting for my drink for 10 minutes and the place was not really that busy. This was probably because of the guy ahead of me when I walked in who had about 7 different modifications to his drink. I have worked in a coffee place and those people are kind of annoying.

I come from cozy towns in Michigan, where when the snow falls heavy the streets grow quiet and everyone you meet has tinge of red to their cheeks and the need for a warm drink.  There's a kind of empathy that comes with this quaintness that is hard to find in Phoenix.  It was there in the old 3 Roots but you had to trade it for slow service. It's not there at Cartel, but that's not what Cartel is about.

Gold Bar is charming.  You're transported, as much as can be hoped for in our strip mall culture, to a cozy living room in another town when you spend a couple of hours here.  The family that runs it knows many of the customers names, they sell hearty foods and heavy drinks.

Just from overhearing the son of the owners talk I can tell you: They have stamp cards. Monday is Pastry stamp Monday. Friday is Extra Shot Friday. Friday and Sunday nights are live Jazz. Sunday morning has classical guitar.  Saturday night is game night, where they have drawings every 20 minutes to give you free drinks, eats and prizes.

So, it is quiet and you can hear everybody else, the drinks are a bit expensive and the food is only okay.  All of those things add up to make this place a little slice of home for someone who is not the biggest fan of living in the city that ate the desert.",N1Q6HiZvnZHjNU712Gymqw

When I had no life (opressed by school, thesis and MCAT) I would spend most of my waking hours at Gold Bar.  I should have been paying them rent.

 Its more than just a coffee shop... it just has this irreplicable ATMOSPHERE and the friendliest employees I've ever encountered.  Its family owned and everyone that works there is somehow related to one another... creates this really personal vibe and you know they take great pride in their product.  

Allan Bros. coffee is the best.  I have even had a friend in Oregon bring some down here for me.  I refuse to drink Starbucks garbage after my palatte has become accustomed to Allan Bros. Its almost annoying because now I frankly dislike any other coffee besides Allan Bros.  Delectable. 

If you are too fancy for plain coffee or want to color outside the lines...try the Granida... so YUMMY! Its frap'esque' but infinitely better.  Also their iced Toddy is great if you want a jolt of caffiene without the bitterness of regular iced coffee.

Instead I ended up in a vulture circle around Southern and McClintock in the dreaded beige strip mall purgatory, trying to remember desperately which generic store front housed the soy-friendly Xtreme. Still groggy, I decided to ""fuck it"" and just do Starfucks.

 I parked in an extremely awkward spot near the taco place (I have no idea why) and while walking around the megaplex of suburbia, I saw...wrought iron cafe tables? What? Gold Bar? Espresso? Double WHAT? I wandered over there, it wavered in the sun like a desert mirage, and as I got closer I saw happy people of all types sitting in some awesome metal seating (very mod) conversing, smoking, drinking delicious looking cups of coffee. Going through the door, I saw a cozy, dark (but still well lit by sunlight) cafe with yummies in the display case and a friendly barista. They don't have any breakfast sandwiches, a big minus for me, but the bagel with butter and cream cheese I had was pretty damn bangin'. They also had soy, and made me a cafe mocha with soy-yummers! Delish! The total amount was around 6 something, which always feels strange for bagel and coffee when I could have gotten an actual breakfast for the cost...but then again the decaf coffee would have tasted like bum residue with dish soap. So there you have it. The owner was there and extremely friendly and apparently they have a website of guitar and jazz. What a happy place! And there were plenty of regulars relaxing or running in to get coffee while friends waited in the car in the ample parking lot. Totally glad I discovered this place so close by as well-yippie! Gold Bar-word.

***

After repeated visits, I have to say I am just not as fond of this place. The prices are OUTRAGEOUS for coffee and food, and I don't feel like I get my moneys worth at all. It feels weird to sit in there and when its too cold to just sit outside and stare at a dying strip mall parking lot, I take it to go and walk around near by Kiswanis Park. 

I feel bad not hurrahing this place, but with Steves Espresso a block away and Tempe based indies Bunna Cafe and Three Roots vastly superior in price and quality (not to mention ambiance), I just say it is an alternative to Starbucks.

Three stars is ""A-OK,"" not how I would describe this place.  I love to support local business - would much rather give my money to a local business owner than some big chain conglomerate.  Sorry Gold Bar, but you'll have to do better if you want to earn business from me.  I won't support local business if they aren't up to standards.  

This was the first time that I have visited this place.  I waited a very long time to place my order with just one person ahead of me.  It seemed to take the coffee person 10 minutes to make one coffee drink.  I ordered some kind of iced tea.  They used the same tea bags that I use at home, nothing special, it wasn't a loose leaf specialty, which is what I would expect from the prices they charge.  I also have to question how old that tea was - it certainly tasted like it was old.......

I waited for a very long time to get my tea.  I finally went up to the counter to ask and they said, ""Oh, we put orders over on the other side.""  I would have thought that they would have called out my order when it was ready rather than just leaving it sit there on the counter.  That's what most places do!  

This place was crowded on the day that I was there, which surprised me.  Lots of people with computers doing work and a few study groups with toddlers running around.  It seemed cramped and small with all of the people stuffed in there.  Wondering why so many people go there......

The other thing that I really disliked was that I had to go into the back of the place to use the restroom.  Dark, dingy and dirty were the words that came to mind.

Ok, so I like it here.  Free wifi, cute layout, indoor and outdoor seating.  Seating is limited, in the sense that its a lot of two tops or a few 4 tops, but nothing for a larger group, like lets say a random study group or whatnot.

They serve pastries, and I purchased one.  The girl at the counter said that the WIFI was free, but they wanted you to make a purchase, which is a reasonable request.  The drinks, in comparison, are priced more at a starbucks level, from staring at the menu.  prepare to spend $4 on a mocha, and $2.50-$4 on a pastry.  

It is quiet in here, no music. But, some people need that, and if I was studying, I would want it quiet in here as well.

Its kind of like back in the old days when you were a kid and had to cut through the stock room at the grocery store to get to the bathrooms.

Not only was the breve mocha that I ordered disgusting, so was the process of watching the barista make my drink.

They use hershey's chocolate from a dirty nacho cheese style pump with chocolate sauce dripping down the sides, and coagulated into a thick cap at the tip of the nozzle.  *Disgusting.  

The espresso shot was made without care, or concern for the fact that it was done way too quickly, and with espresso grounds that were ground way before I walked in the door.  Possibly way before the barista started her shift.   *Gross

And finally.  The milk.  She steamed the milk with the automatic steam wand.  This was a huge red flag.  Those are notorious for burning milk and making disgusting drinks.  Well, both were accomplished. 

The steam wand was tinted white from lack of cleaning.  And the worst part was that near the end of the wand was a DARK CHEESE that had accumulated from burning milk and not cleaning the wand after every use. 
Which is FREAKIN - DISGUSTING.

I wasted 5 bucks on an overpriced small mocha, and threw it away after taking a sip.

'Giant Coffee'....  hmmm
While I have no idea what the hell that's supposed to mean, I do like that it seems to elicit  playful banter, in which we get to bust out our best porn star voices and use the phrase 'GIANT coffee' in place of other more descriptive words whilst discussing where to go for our Saturday morning fix. It's fun, try it. 

On to the meat and potatoes :

The coffee was good. My mocha was not sweet at all, something I actually enjoyed. There's a fine line between sweet and syrupy and hey, I'd rather have to add a lump of sugar myself than be stuck in nestle chocolate syrup hell. 

The little chicky that took our order was cute and bubbly. She asked if we had ever been there before and seemed to genuinely care that we enjoy our experience. I really like the idea of not yelling out the customers name but table service for coffee also seemed a bit weird. I would prefer the latter of course and could definitely get over the awkwardness.. it's probably just me anyway..

The space itself was outstanding. I am a table girl, not a couch girl (especially if I'm there less to socialize and more to surf). The work counter area is perfect for me as I don't like having people at my back when I'm working on my novel..... okay, checking my facebook, whatever. Having someone at my back when I'm on my computer is a pet peeve of mine and there is enough seating to accommodate multiple people with similar neurosis. High five! 

My only real complaint is the lack of an obvious space or bus-tub in which to leave your empties. Maybe I just missed it. I'm certainly not leaving it on the table and felt kinda silly walking back up to the counter all wide eyed and dorky 'Errrr...hey guys, what do I do with this...'. Again, I'm a neurotic train-wreck so sometimes human interaction gets the best of me.

It blends the clean lines of modern cool with the rustic reusability of the Bunky Boutique space that shares the same room. Visually stunning!

The coffee is mighty fine, though I wish it was sourced from an in-state roastery. I'm all for sipping from well-crafted beans, but I'm kind of shocked Matt went this route. Still, sourcing from California is probably better from an eco-friendly standpoint than what most places around here do. 

The bathroom, I must say, is the best-smelling men's bathroom in downtown Phoenix. Let's make sure it stays that way. Also, it's Arctic cold in there regardless of time of day. That's amazing during the summer. Let's hope it's equally as toasty come wintertime.

Whenever I'm in Phoenix and looking for coffee I usually head to Giant. Nothing against Lux or Lola just down the street, but Giant is more focused on their product. Giant has a standard of sourcing great coffee and using high quality product.

On my last visit I ordered a cappuccino and it was nearly perfect. Warm, but not too hot. Smooth by still having a strong espresso dynamic. Perfect balance. Before I left I went up to the counter to order a cup of coffee to go. They have a great setup for to-go coffee. They brew great coffee in large quantities so that those who are on the go can get a great cup of coffee quickly. The barista was very sweet and informed me the coffee had been sitting for a while. She said it would be a few minutes and she would brew me a fresh pot. It was the middle of the week, and I think there were only two other people in the shop, who had already ordered drinks. How easily could she have served me that mediocre cup of coffee? Very. But this showed her integrity and pride in their coffee to brew a whole new batch just for me. It's the little things like that that impress me the most.

I recommend this coffee shop for anyone in the downtown Phoenix area. Not to mention the cool sliding glass doors in front that they open up when the weather is nice. There's some comfy chairs and cook wooden tables to sit and enjoy the weather from.

I've tried replicating it on several occasions, but Giant's HVL is some sort of magical elixir of the creamiest of dairy (which I'm pretty sure is purchased from a local farm) and Bob McClendon's honey. Coffee and chai are delicious and the pastries are tasty. The ambiance is awesome and the staff is super friendly.
On to my not-so-much list. On the food front, I've ordered the breakfast burrito two or three times but have never quite fallen for it.  The prosciutto and eggs had the potential to be killer but didn't QUITE make it to that ""I want to eat you for every meal"" level. My other disappointment is that I don't find hanging out in Giant to be very comfortable. I know that it sounds kind of weird, but the bar stools are kind of awkward to sit on and the chairs just aren't... comfy. They are also kind of strange about charging for extra things like honey.

Giant Coffee have beans, dark...flavorful...hard...b e a n s.    ... anyway, got lost there for a bit. Flag me.

The only real difference between Giant and most NW roasters/cafes is the service. 

In NW, it is kind of lik this: ""Uh you came here to get coffee, you should be lucky we are even making you this awesome espresso and allowing you to drink our art in a cup.... Andddd you still have not ordered. Know what you want before you speak to me.""

In Giant, "" HEY! Lets talk about what you want to talk about, oh you are here for great tasting coffee? I thought we could Socratic method for about 30min?""

The coffee itself is okay, very strong and a little burnt, as seems to be the trend in recent years. I could make it palatable with a lot of cream and some funky all-natural organic free trade green sugar-free alternative. It was definitely way too strong for my SO, who made a bit of a sphincter face with his first sip.

The pastries are from Tammie Coe -- tasty, yes, but nothing you can't get elsewhere.

The space IS gorgeous, don't get me wrong, and it's my favorite part of this shop. Disappointingly, the bathrooms are really average. Usually spiffy places like this have bomb ass bathrooms. The attached Bunky Boutique is super cute, and it deserves its own review.

So yeah. Verdict? Too many other places to get coffee in this area... especially ones that open before 7 am, when I'm usually pounding the streets, desperate for caffeine. Time will tell how GC pans out...",UoBfwbXaixelZBghbJ2cSg

The coffee was delicious. I am happy to find a non corporate chain coffeehouse in AZ. The baristas were friendly hipsters, so I felt right at home. =)

I'm a macchiato man, stained through and through, and Matt Poole marks his Four Barrel espresso with Strauss organic milk, so I am a happy man at Giant.  The sparkling water sidecar they serve with espressos and macchiatos is an expert touch. The espresso is smoother, say, than the coppery undertones of Lux, and Giant serves it in handle-less demitasse ceramics that are hot (not too hot) to the touch.

PASTRY and FOOD

The daily breakfast burrito (wrapped for takeaway or reheated and served on a plate in 12-15 minutes) is rarely vegetarian, but when it is, the tortilla is flaky, the eggs fluffy, and the peppers and potatoes local.

The bread pudding is chewy delicious.

I usually opt for the toasted bagel because the fresh-daily cream cheese is varied and fresh (dill or bell paper or carrot).

AMBIENCE

On weekends and afternoons, it's less swarmed than Lux or Lola, and feels open and clean with concrete floors, high ceilings, clean lines, and bold materials (steel, wood, glass).

The floor-to-ceiling glass panels accordion fold back to reveal a totally open front, great for gazing at Cancer Survivor's Park, Phoenix Art Museum, and McDowell & Central Ave.

Bunky next door is sleepy, but every item is artfully placed.  Occasional succulents dot the interior and exterior.

EXTRAS

Giant now accepts credit/debit via the nifty Square app on the house iPad.   The music rarely changes, and I have been hearing the same playlist for about a year (Spoon, Heartless Bastards, etc.).  Giant has dog treats, but I believe they prefer pups to be on the stoop out front.  No bike rack currently but a convenient railing serves just fine.",rWDFpIYRyAC4N95zIwTzMA

We both ordered honey vanilla lattes.  These were done to perfection.  I ordered soy milk and this was the best soy foam that I have ever tasted, perfectly velvety and just the right amount. I spent years working for a major coffee place that starts with the letter ""S"" and I am a bit of a foam fanatic. 

Also, a beautiful pour on both of the lattes and a great balance of sweet honey and caramel colored espresso. 

I was happy to see rice milk, soy milk and goat milk as options, I will definitely try the honey vanilla with goat milk next time.

Food; Coffee & Tea,CdqTxe171tKTOkk8T15GGA,Giant Coffee,135,4,4,2,"Ack!  So I was terribly excited while waiting months and months for Giant to open because 1) I like the tucked away location 2) I love coffee and 3) We spend a lot of time at the library.

So this morning after scooping up some Krispy Kreme donuts (mmmm) to take over to my friend Kate's house for brunch, I decided to pop by and grab a coffee to go since the previous 2 attempts at visiting Giant were met with a ""closed"" sign.

I gave 2 stars because I really do like the space.  There were a few people hanging out and I walked up to the counter where 2 girls were working.  The girl behind the cash register was talking to a guy at the counter.  I then saw the cash only sign which wasn't such a big deal to me as I had some cash in my car today, though normally I don't and probably wouldn't have made the trek to CVS as I was in a hurry and had my 3 yr. old in tow.

I asked the girl not talking if she could start my drink while I ran out to get my money.  She told me to order from the other girl.  I took two steps to my left and stood behind the chatting guy.  They kept chatting.  No bueno.  I looked at the other girl again who was just standing there, and again asked her if I could order my drink.  She looked at the talking girl and finally said ""sure.""

I ordered 2 shots of espresso over ice with a shot of vanilla.  My summer morning caffeine jolt.  I was told by said girl that she couldn't make this for me.

""Excuse me????""  I was told that she was not allowed to make this, as the espresso was to only be ordered in so it could be drank (drunk?) within 10 minutes for the ""flavor branding"" of Giant.  I tried to persuade her again, letting her know I didn't want to drink it there - nor did I want to drink it hot, as I'd just been hanging out in a 105 degree parking lot for the past hour.  I was told ""no.""

NO????  SERIOUSLY???  This girl - who I didn't even know - was telling me what I could or couldn't drink when I hadn't had ANY caffeine yet!  It's probably a good thing my daughter was with me after all, as being turned down for espresso + PMS don't co-exist very happily.

She asked if I'd like something different.  I simply said ""no,"" when I really wanted to say oh so much more with included %%$$&*(#*$^$ words.  

I will not be back.  Thankfully there are other options (with my #1 being Royal Coffee) and I would have even made the trip up to Lux if I hadn't been in a hurry.

So french pressed coffee at Kate's it was, and I would strongly recommend that Matt get over his ""flavor branding"" theory if he wants to thrive and to teach his employees the concept of the customer being right if they are polite, have cash, and aren't asking for something ridiculously out of the ordinary.

I am originally from Seattle and love a good cup of coffee.  Giant Coffee is a wonderful establishment with friendly service and excellent coffee.  Let me list the things I love about this place. 
1. Attention to detail (Strauss milk)(high quality soy milk)
2. Excellent barista's (Great customer service)
3. Atmosphere (wonderful interior design)
4. location (across from Phoenix Art Museum

Giant Coffee is a great place to just get away and relax or meet up with friends.  Parking has never been a problem for me and I usually get a spot right up front.  I don't understand why some posts claim to have a problem with the barista's customer service because they are really friendly and take the time to get to know you.  I have never in my life met barista's this nice and I have been to a lot of coffee shops in my time.  Also just last week I saw one of my favorite barista's at Giant Coffee come in on his day off to get coffee and he ended up spending a few hours talking to regulars he knew.  WOW, that says a lot.  Ya this place is no Starbucks thank god... and they don't write your name on your cup and throw it at you the second you decide to sit down.  Phoenicians let me give you some advice... A coffee shop is a magical place you go to get away from your hectic life so try and slow down a little and smell the espresso.

The products:

Giant serves organic coffee, every espresso drink is made lovingly with a double ristretto shot. If you don't know what that is, you won't care. Organic farm fresh milk. Amazing pastries and daily breakfast including a burrito of the day (yum). You can also order a side of toast and jam anytime....it's toast, but it's special. The burrito takes awhile so call ahead if you're in a real hurry. This isn't a Taco Bell.

The thing I want to highlight has already been covered: HONEY VANILLA LATTE. It's so good. And do yourself a favor and order it with breve at least once in awhile as a treat. You will thank me...perfection!

You can also order pour over coffee here, which is what I usually get if not doing a caloric latte splurge. Pour over brewing results in the smoothest cup of coffee ever. Even what can usually be described as lively (read: somewhat more acidic) Latin American beans have a taste you can't experience with a French press. And African coffees (my favorite) are earthier than ever! It's a must for anyone who loves their coffee...and I don't mean with cream, sugar, and other crap in it. But as many good things do, a pour over does take a few minutes so don't expect to try it on the fly.

The atmosphere:

Cool building that has an open airy set up, especially when the front slider is open. The vibe is modern, urban, and comfortable all at once. It makes me feel far more like I'm at home in Seattle than TTB Lux (trying to be) or Lola. The set up for studying or working is pretty sweet - the seating is great and includes booth-like spots on one side that are nice for setting up shop with your laptop and a beverage. 
The seats in the front looking out at the street and park are great for relaxing with friends or quiet reflection. The people who work here are mostly warm, friendly, and nice. Most importantly, they know how to prepare handcrafted drinks on a LaMarzocco machine!

Overall, I just love it here. My new best of in the 602.. great place to support local! Oh, and the Cancer Survivor Park is across the street/in front. Worth walking through - love that it's there.",NqeD28GGg1Wdj9BfaHqr4g

It's a state-of-the-art coffee shop that offers all the popular items at good prices. Go there and enjoy. Visit in conjunction with a trip to the Art Museum, Phoenix Little Theatre or the main library. Drop by after getting some Thai food on the corner. It's a nice place. . . . 

But . . .  :-)

I had a few thoughts while enjoying an iced Americano today. The table that holds the sugar and cream and stirrers near the counter is some relic of a machine shop: an adjustable-height table of very heavy construction, with dials and massive casters and a requisite amount of patina. It looks splendid in its unpretentious way. It was designed and built and used for years as a genuine tool in an industrial surrounding. And in its prosaic and rugged simplicity it stands for something that nothing else in the place can claim. It's real, whereas the finished plywood on the walls, the welded girders under the tables, the exposed cinder blocks of the walls are merely ""authentic"".

And as I sat pondering this today, slowly drinking my Americano (itself a relic of the sort of conundrum I was pondering) something occurred to me: 

Authenticity is to reality what margarine is to butter.

Something that strives for authenticity is just as artificial (perhaps moreso) than things that just strive to be entertaining, or good-tasting, or intriguing in some way. There's no more ""reality"" in something that's synthetically and self-consciously ""authentic"" than in something like Taco Bell or Olive Garden. There is actually LESS reality in anything contrived to be ""authentic"" with even a small amount of self-consciousness.

And so I recalled stuff from the late sixties and early seventies--when ""authenticity"" first seemed to ride a wave into the popular consciousness and everyone wanted to wear granny glasses and finish their own furniture. And I realized something:

American culture has been a fraud for the last 40 years or so.

After visiting Matt's Big Breakfast and The Roosevelt, I knew the atmosphere at Giant would be sublime, and I was right. While I had already been inside for a few Merz events and art shows, it was nice to actually sit down with a book and a coffee and experience a cafe like it is meant to be.

The coffees I've had were decent, but no threat to Cartel or Royal (and there is something about importing it from a CA roasters that sits wrong with me), but at least they are making the effort to raise the bar in the central city. However, decent coffee is fine with me, as to me, the drinks themselves are only an excuse to hang out with friends or a good book in cool place.

From the other reviews,It sounds like I may have to give the honey vanilla latte a try... if only they had a loyalty card ;-) Although I could do without the 'price premium' for a toddy (if anything it's easier to make that a regular).  

While it won't be my 'go to' coffee joint, it will be a regular stop while visiting the library or Art Museum, freeing myself from the teen scene and blue hair beat crowds of  their respective cafes.

Coffee: I usually order a latte and it is always excellent, smooth and sweet and doesn't require any modification. 

Food: I've had an english muffin with jam, and I've tasted one of the pain du chocolat pastries they offer as well. Both superb.

Price: yeah... well, a little pricey, but in my opinion, worth the extra pennies. From the coffees (Four Barrel Coffee), to the organic milk from Strauss Creamery, and the pastries and breads from Tammy Coe and MJ (I think that's where I remember them telling me these were from)...totally worth it.

Space/Environment: LOVE the giant (pardon the pun) open front, the various options for seating, the free wi-fi, the music selection, and the fact that Matt and Erenia (the owners) regularly pop in and talk to their customers. 

The not-so-great things (there are only two): The hours aren't great - YET. Tues/Sun 7AM to 3PM. But they say they'll be open 7am to 7pm starting 6/15. Nice! They only take cash right now.

Food; Coffee & Tea,CdqTxe171tKTOkk8T15GGA,Giant Coffee,135,4,3.83,4,"The places I *haven't* reviewed always surprise me, because more often than not they are places I regular - in this case, Giant.  I've literally been coming here since it opened, I was there for the first year anniversary and literally countless days in between, yet I haven't given a Yelp review yet - weird!

If Yelp had half stars, I'd give Giant 4.5, but all the slight nuances add up, and I don't feel right giving 5.

The coffee bean:
I'll start by saying Four Barrel is a great choice; I've always loved it, and probably always will - 4B is one of my favorite coffee shops in the world.  That said, I'd prefer something local was used.  The coffee has to be shipped here weekly, from San Francisco, which in turn makes for a mixed experience.  If you want beans, you have to deal with the dates they have available, which by the time it gets processed in SF, shipped, repackaged (at Giant) and put on the shelf, is at least a week old at this point.

The shop:
The shop itself is great.  I've been absolutely in love with the giant front windows that open up to let in the fresh air (when it's not a zillion degrees outside).  I love the lighting, mix of modern steel structure and vintage furniture.  Attached to Bunky, who, while on the expensive side, has some cool stuff.  The baristas are generally pretty great, with a choice few being extremely great.  Credit/debit purchases require $5+, which is slightly annoying if all you want is a small drink; I generally bring cash.  There's roughly 4 parking spots out front, countless parking across the street at CVS (literally a 15 second walk from here) and about 12-15 spots in the back - you enter either from the alley just east of 1st street [if you're by the library], or go between the gas station and the Thai restaurant [if you're entering from McDowell]).

Drinks:
The drink menu is great.  You can get timeless classics, or new-old twists.  This is one of two shops in the whole PHX area that does a pour-over right.  Espresso is pulled short and flavor-abound.  The drip flows constantly, and generally is re-made after it's sat too long.  I'm a straight up coffee person, so I stick to pour-over, drip or espresso, but the mocha is a delightful drink, with a good quality chocolate, home-made whipped creme and chocolate shavings on top.  Giant serves Straus dairy with their drinks, which is a plus in my book.  The beans rotate with Four Barrel's bean menu.  Like the other venues Matt Pool runs, expect no substitutions or special orders here (which shouldn't be a shock if you ever frequence Matt's Big Breakfast or Roosevelt).  I understand not serving a traditional machiatto or espresso to go, but there are some ""rules"" that could be stretched here to accommodate for the customer.

Fare:
I've mixed opinions of the fare at Giant.  It's nothing to do with taste and creativity - those are generally spot on.  Different things are generally whipped up, so you never get bored with the selection.  That said, in the past (and I think this baker is no longer working here), I've seen quick-bread that wasn't cooked throughout, which is one of the most disgusting things to stumble upon while eating something tasty.  Again, I've not experienced this or anything negative lately.

All in all:
Great shop, great tastes, friendly baristas.  A couple annoyances, but overall a good go-to.",hVkQbDk61hmIi5iVm3IkZw

You will like it because it's brought to you by the creators of Matt's big breakfast and they care about quality and creating a warm environment for you to visit everyday.

They are not 5 stars yet because they can focus on better service, the coffee is great but the coffee takes too long to prep. Argue all you want but a coffee shop should be fast.

Minuses: Cute 20-something baristas play their self-consciously cool music too loud. Parking in the back is limited and sketchy. But the biggest, baddest minus of all?

Giant Coffee is in a great building located off first street and McDowell. Giant manages to strike a balance between modern/industrial and cozy. Plenty of space with various seating, along with a great big glass garage door which is opened during good weather.

The coffee and snacks are what you would expect from Matt & Ernie, they are well thought out, and delicious. The honey vanilla latte is so tasty, and the pastries pair very nicely with it. One tip, the breakfast burritos take 15 minutes to prepare and heat, so just know if you are trying to get one to go, plan ahead, or they can give you heating instructions. Since this isn't QT, the stuff is a step above, and good things are worth waiting for.

Last but not least, the service at Giant Coffee is, well- Giant! Every time I go to Giant, the service is fast, friendly, and warm. I admit to my locally owned bias, and this coffee shop is great, and another welcome addition to the 602. I really cannot think of  a good reason to pass a locally owned place in favor of a corporate company.

It was nice, they had the wide doors open to the outside and with the weather not  being 118, it felt good.  Oh, they had the obligatory Hip-Tards with spiked hair on Mac Books wearing vests and looking self-important and all that, but they didn't know the term ""Skinny"".  Huh???  Wait, isn't skinny an official Batista term for Sugar free, skim milk?

After explaining the concept to the nice man behind the counter, he informed me that they have no sugar free vanilla syrup but did have skim milk.  OK no problem, well not really.

Ordered a skinny (with sugar vanilla syrup), hot latte.  I sat and peeked about the cute Bunky boutique next door and accidental purchased a line of men's skin care products by Baxter.  Hard to resist a new skin care product (TWSS).

Came back and drank my (fool me with the coffee art leaf on top of the creme alert****) vanilla latte.  It was good, but not that hot and kind of small for $4.

I will definitely check it out again, but no rush to rush back.  If I lived close by, I would certainly go more often and try another type of espresso drink.

Giant Coffee is located across the street from the Phoenix Theatre and is a mere block away from the Burton Barr Library.

The big window in the front was not open when I was there, but there were still people sitting facing the window.  I found that a little odd, but then... so am I.

I ordered a large mexican style hot cocoa made with soy milk and it ran me about $5.  The cocoa was good, but not great.  $5 for hot cocoa is a little steep for me.  I like places that don't charge extra for soy milk (ahem Fair Trade Cafe).  

About the staff, the guy who took my order (who was referred to as Luke Perry by a previous reviewer) was very friendly and helpful.  I didn't have any issues with him at all.  Maybe his behavior was corrected by a manager?  I thought he was nice... and nice and cute is never bad in my book.  

There WAS another guy making the drinks who was chatting with a girl the entire time I was there.  I literally left and went to the bathroom and came back and he was still chatting with her.  I didn't mind at all because my drink was ready when I got out.  Maybe Giant Coffee employees are just uber friendly.

The reason I am giving Giant Coffee 3 stars is the following:

1.) The bathroom was filthy at 9 a.m.  I can't imagine why a women's bathroom would have an overflowing trash can and be so dirty at just 9 in the morning.  I know there were only two employees working there at the time and they were both male, but I cannot imagine the number of women who would have visited the bathroom in the morning would have created that much trash.  It was gross.

2.) The price of the drinks was just a little steep for what you get.

3.) The ambience, crowd = not for me.  I felt the setup of the shop put me on display.  I did not like it.  I felt like this was a place I would just order something from and leave, whereas I was looking for a Sit and Stay kind of place.  I just felt like I did not belong here.  

Overall, I would come here again with a friend for a chat and people watching.  I would not come here again on my own.",64YY0h0ZAR2nbzxbx0IwJg

The important part is the coffee. Not bad. They currently use beans from Four Barrel in SF, CA. They do a pretty good job. If you drink straight espresso shots, this will be a unique taste for you. It is very lightly roasted, with a strong citrus taste, NOT typical of espresso. In a latte or cappuccino, it is balanced by the sweetness of the milk.

I have also had 4 different coffees there, as their line-up does change, based off availability. Don't go for the regular brew. Choose a pour-over instead.

As far as the lobby goes. Again pros and cons. The seats are pretty much immoveable. So if you may have to move seats to accommodate your group. The wall has padded seats with outlets for your laptop needs.
The benches in the middle are a little hard on the backside.

However, get there when the front glass is open, and you have an amazing view of what the day can offer. The entire storefront opens up to reveal ""the world"".

It was First Friday, so very busy and very chilly, so I went actually a few times in one night.  First run was with the veggie soup, that was fabulous-- I can't wait to try other flavors.  Second run was a plain coffee and it was  tasty, not bitter- I drink coffee daily and often find it bitter at a lot of places. Third run was a mint tea- can't ever go wrong with mint tea.  

Now coffee houses, in my opinion are based a lot on the employees/owners, the vibe and the other customers.  The employees were above and beyond kind and the vibe was cool and as the night went on, it got even more cool.  It was open mic night and people were reading poetry-- some better than others but my favorite was a humorous poet who had the whole room in stitches.   I've never been to an open mic poet night, it was interesting.  I was talking to my friend and I got shooshed and someone yelled ""MAN ON MIC!"" and I felt like a frickin' moron but whatever, I understand.  I was new-- I didn't know the rules.

We (Himself and I) were passing through town and came here specifically for the non-MSG menu items before we said our farewells to Phoenix.

What we adored: Free parking in the nearby shady garage, large sandwich portions, friendly staff, low prices. I enjoyed the house salad, entree size (see photo). Cool music on the stereo system. 

What we could've done without: Bluetooth Douchebag guy loudly talking to Suit Lady, full priced refills on iced coffee.

I encouraged Him to purchase a bag of beans to bring home. We would love to see non-mayo recipe options for the sandwiches on the menu. Consider it, please?

I work for a grassroots non profit organization. This will be important later in the story. 

I first discovered Fair Trade through one of the owners, who also happens to volunteer for the organization I work for. (Remember I said my job would be important to the story?) I came in a few times and was continually impressed with the friendly staff, great coffee, and overall great atmosphere. 

Because of my job (and lack of office space) I have a LOT of coffee meetings. Sometimes it's all I ever do. And FTC is a great location, and it's way cooler than Starbucks. So my coworkers and I definitely give them a ton of business with our meetings! 

The Sunday brunch is awesome, everyone must try the egg puff and the potatoes, they are to die for. It's a great way to spend a Sunday morning!

The free WiFi is also awesome when I need a Central location to work. Sometimes I refer to it as my office.

It is located a stone's throw away from where I live and I can often be found there. I actually haven't sampled the coffee, I don't drink the stuff, but my husband enjoys it. I do love the iced tea, hot chocolate, and hot teas. The sandwiches are great and the baked goods are amazing, save the bagels. (They are from Chompie's) I love the filled croissants. In recent months, their quiches had begun to get really salty and they took them off the menu and replaced them with frittatas, which look exactly like the quiches. I actually asked where the egg was when I ordered my first one. Their Sunday brunch is great (love the chili cheese egg puff or whatever its called and the sweet potatoes mixed in with the side of potatoes is great!) when I don't feel like going out to a sit down brunch and just want to run and get something quickly, they are the only place in this neighborhood that provides that on a Sunday morning...there are no bagel shops or anything. What I like most about Fair Trade is that if you are there to do work you can literally sit there all day and be able to have lunch, unlike at other coffee shops where the food sampling is limited to various baked goods. With the soups, salads, and sandwiches Fair Trade really functions more as a cafe. 

Service is always friendly; however, lately it hasn't been as on point as it once was. I wonder if they sent the more experience people to the new location and have all the newbies at this location. The rotating art is fun and a great resource for local artists to get their work out there. The new furniture they have put in is a little out of place and does make it feel overly cramped and hot at times though.

first i don't get all picky with what i get, it's a large drip every morning. i usually steer for Medium Roast..but for the most part i like what i get..dark or medium..so i stopped specifying. it is just good so why complicate things with being picky.

Fair Trade also gives out discounts for RS residents, Gov. employees, students, and seniors. as a resident of the apartment ""complex"" fair trade is in. i get my resident discount..i think it's 10%. which is nice because it brings the cost down below 2 bucks for a large coffee..i then feel more justified with the 1 dollar tip i usually leave.

Mmm the Peruvian roast, how I love thee. And yes, students get a 10% discount. Plus all the coffee is certified Fair Trade (some are organic). Woo!

They have started to have more and more fresh vegan pastries from their kitchen. I heard they just got a vegan pastries cookbook so I can't wait to see what kind of other treats they will have for me in the future.

the pricing is right for their beverages and aside from being involved in fair trade, they also like the environment. they've got a spot for you to put your sleeves to be used again. brilliant.

the only reason i'm giving it four instead of five stars is because i had to go to the bathroom really badly and i couldn't use it because someone was in it for a good 20 minutes while i was waiting and i had to wait even longer and use it at the next place because i was scared to go in, at that point. not their fault.",B8t1hkG4EX7ar4r9PCEJMA

For awhile, I spent three nights a week here either meeting about my book or writing it.  It was such a relaxed atmosphere and the employees were the nicest coffee shop employees in town.  

Since moving to Ahwatukee, I have not had much occasion to visit the cafe.  Recently, I have been downtown more frequently.  I've popped in three times in the last week just to read.  

They now have the rewards terminal for Belly next to their register, which I've seen popping up at small businesses in town.  They have bigger tables.  They have gotten rid of their retail offerings (apparently they were collecting too much dust).  Their pastry case has been removed.  

But other than those basic changes, Fair Trade Cafe is essentially the same.  It is a great local cafe where you can get basic eats (today I had an egg and cheese croissant) and good drinks at a fair price.  And you can feel good doing it, too.  They support fair trade practices.  

I've tried a few other local coffee shops in town and they're just not for me.  The vibe here at Fair Trade is relaxed.  I feel comfortable sipping on my soy hot cocoa or Italian soda at my own pace as I read a book.  I don't feel rushed.  I feel only the utmost relaxation.  

If you're working on a project, having a quick meeting, writing a paper (or a book) or just want a place to pop in to get away from the hustle and bustle for awhile, Fair Trade Cafe should be your place.

This place reminds me so much of SF Bay Area cafes.  It's just like home!

I wanted a coffee shop where I could get some work done, get a swift kick of energy and do so in a comfortable and local environment. I found that at Fair Trade. 

Ever since attending DPJ's Radiate Phoenix Event where local coffee shop owners spoke about their brands, I've been eager to check out Fair Trade and today was the perfect excuse to do so. I walked inside and was immediately welcomed by the smell of freshly roasted coffee and the therapeutic sound of coffee shop chit chat and the grinder humming to the beat of a fresh cup 'o Joe. The girl at the counter was friendly, attentive and definitely knew her coffees. I was tempted to try the mocha chocolate latte on special, but the barista convinced me that the iced coffee with sugar free chocolate and nonfat milk was the way to go. I know not to question the expert so I went for it. Note to self... my intuition was correct. I will always take the baristas advice from now on. The iced coffee was refreshing, full of a much-needed caffeine kick and just what the energy bunny ordered. 

I really like the character and environment at Fair Trade. The shop was packed with coffee drinkers, business folks and even friendly neighborhood policemen. I am pretty sure I saw a Pastor making his way through as well. With the dynamic group of visitors, the music was comforting but not distracting. I saw plenty of outdoor seating options but sadly, the 110 degree weather kept me from enjoying a fresh breeze today.

So in summary, I give Fair Trade two thumbs up (aka four stars) for the quality and comfort they provide to the coffee addict.

It purports to be a supporter of ""sustainable living through economic growth."" By being ""Fair Trade Certified"", this venue agrees to the following principles taken from the Transfair USA website:

* Fair price: Democratically organized farmer groups receive a guaranteed minimum floor price and an additional premium for certified organic products. 

* Fair labor conditions: Workers on Fair Trade farms enjoy freedom of association, safe working conditions, and living wages. Forced child labor is strictly prohibited. 

* Direct trade: With Fair Trade, importers purchase from Fair Trade producer groups as directly as possible, eliminating unnecessary middlemen... 

I guess that's cool. 

I'm writing this seated at one of its tables, supposedly to get some work done (free wifi). It's got a nice, direct view of our downtown skyline. Light guitar music in the background. Light lunch fare is available, and I just finished a very sloppy, but good, egg salad sandwhich. The crowd here actually seems somewhat ASU-ish. In fact some guy came up to me when I first sat down and asked me to take a sociological survey as part of some ASU study (he was here with the cafe's permission).

These two places are great places for treats, tea and friendly service. I rode my bike from the AZFCU to the civic space, grabbed and Ice tea and some gum samples, then biked through ASU to Think. By the time I arrived at the Roosevelt/Central train station i was so parched i went to this Fair Trade, asked them if i could get a refill instead of wasting a cup, thinking i would pay for an entirely new Iced Tea, when she only charged me $.75. that was awesome!!! finally a place that is, well, Fair! they didn't have my favorite Banana Nut cookies, but that's okay i'll forgive them lol. 

however if you ever see the banana nut cookies available, get them fast! they are the most tasty & moist little bites of heaven you will ever eat! this place also offers tons of vegan items. 

they offer free wi-fi, have inside and outside seating both in front of the shop and in the courtyard right behind it too. ride a bike? you'll find 2 bike racks in front and back as well. you will also find handcrafted items to purchase from around the world, including music-which can be sampled on the sampler close to the courtyard. i can't get enough of their green tea, but the others are deolilcious too and at only $2.25, with a $.75 refill you can't go wrong. so next time you take the train into downtown, stop at the roosevelt/central station and get yourself some Fair Trade on!",0g6TyhGJXvLQNr7d7LsDnw

Food; Coffee & Tea,sF3k_ZSndah1OwduVlb8_w,Elevate Coffee Co,46,4.5,4.1,5,"After a long night of entertaining guests there is no better reward than coffee for all the hard work done. And coffee did I get. I always passed by this place since I work in the same plaza where this place is located, but never had a chance to go into it. Its a very chic coffee shop tucked away from the busy main street and truly a gem if you decide to visit. As soon as you enter your senses are greeted by the smell of roasting coffee and an ambient atmosphere. Here is a break down:

Pros:

1. Comfortable: The place is littered with plush comfortable chairs ranging in shapes and sizes. However if you prefer wooden chairs there are plenty of those too. The music isn't over powering which gives no opportunity for it to become a distraction or annoyance. 

2. Staff: The Batista's where very kind and knowledgeable in their jobs. Also they are not afraid to chat with you for a tid bit while you order and pay.

3. Text Message Ordering: This thing is the bomb. All I have to do is text my order to them and pick it up at the store without waiting in line!

4. Rock Springs Pie: For those of you who are not familiar with who Rock Springs is, it is a small little diner in the middle of no where on the way to Flagstaff. They are known for their pies which, might I add, are divine. If you love pie and don't want to drive half way to Prescott, then i suggest you stop by here and pick some up! I suggest the Jack Daniels Pecan Pie!

Cons:

1. Busy: Sometimes it gets really busy in here and seats can be scarce, however don't let that deter you because there are always seats outside.

2. Food Time Limits: Some of their food are only made at certain times. For example, the crepes are no longer available after 8pm. 

Over all I fell in love with place which is a bit strange for a picky person like me, but this place really made an excellent first impression. I think this just became my favorite coffee shop, for now.",yT5zeZCV2jDHdQX5xBSxpA

I heard about Elevate from some people at work, and since my husband is a coffee fanatic, I thought we should definitely try it. The decor was awesome but getting to the counter was a different story... The 3 women on staff seemed totally and completely disconnected from their work. No smiles, no suggestions since it was our first time, just long faces and monosyllabic answers to my questions. I would understand if it was 1 person maybe having a bad day, or even if it were early on a Sunday, but it was 10 AM and it was all three of the women that we interacted with. 

On the positive side: I had a vanilla bean creme (no coffee) and it was very good, like a frappe but without the java kick. I also had a sausage breakfast burrito, which was really good (they have pepper-jack cheese which added a little unexpected heat to it.) 

My husband had an Americano which he said was good, but his Nutella & banana crepe had been microwaved, so it was chewy. He ate the other half of my burrito instead of finishing it.

I am not prone to giving bad reviews and because of the food they're getting a 3 instead of a 2, but the lack of personable service was very disconcerting and I don't think I'll go back for that reason.",LsPz1sDewmNExoAtx7ubrA

Melty gelatinous gummy balls that are sproingy on the teeth is one way to describe it. Black phlegmatic chunks of mucous laden smokers lung is another. It's all about perspective.

I happen to like the gooey little pearls that collect at the bottom of milky green tea, and Eba Cafe is the best place in the valley to indulge. They used to be located just north of ASU and I would pop in before classes, until one day they vanished without a trace. I was adrift without my convenient bubbly study break fare, but as fate would have it, I was stuck in gridlock on Broadway and what should mine eyes behold? A bright red ""Eba"" in a strip mall across from the dairy plant. 

What a sweet reunion it was! Jelly goodness afloat in milky green or black tea with one of thirty-some possible flavors added!
 
The black and green tea are traditional stand-bys, but if you're feeling daring, try the wintermelon tea. It has no sugar added but the natural sugar is so incredibly potent that I couldn't finish a thimble full sample without experiencing the puckered, day-uuum-that's-sweet face. After you've chosen your tea, try to narrow down the flavor additives, red bean is a solid choice but watermelon is my ultimate trump card. Mango, taro and honeydew are also pretty tasty. Then decide if you want some kind of gelatinous goop added to your drink. They have several different types including boba and coffee jellies, which I've heard are great in, well, coffee drinks.

Eba also has some light lunch and munch options if you feel like nibbling. I've had the green curry chicken bowl, which is earthy with a nice spice, but the accompanying rice was a little dried out. If you're just there for a snack, try the brick toast with coconut. Delish! They also serve gelato, but between you and me, it looked kinda nast.

However, as far as the tea part went I thought my tea was entirely too sweet (passion fruit)....I mean there should be a slight flavor to it but this was very sweet.  I plan to try more flavors however so I will be sure to update on those.  They do have a ton of options though so there is plenty of room to explore.  I didn't realize until after I ordered that they have shave ice!  I loooove shave ice.  Its definitely another item on the list to try at a later date.

Eba is located in the strip mall that has Fast Signs in it in case you drive right by like I did and didn't even see it.....I'm not sure it has a large sign on the storefront.

I can get over the fact that it's in a strip mall and that the decor leaves much to be desired. But their boba tea was awful. I had banana with boba bubbles. We ordered edamame (which was fine...pretty hard to screw that up...as I'm sure they had a frozen package of it ready to go) and tofu. The tofu was the worst I've ever had in my life. And again, the drinks were below sub par.

Maybe I'm just spoiled by the boba tea I had back in IL. But I didn't think central Illinois was exactly a hot spot for asian treats. I would assume that Phoenix should have a better taste for those sorts of things. But based on Eba Cafe I'd say that's false.

I would not recommend this to anyone. Hopefully there are other boba places. Or maybe I really ordered the wrong thing. I'm always open to suggestion and correction. In the mean time, I'll go on thinking that this was a waste of my time and money!",MwJVSTsUB-htphNZaIC43g

Picture this: A Young Woman moves from a city known for its Asian fare and bubble (boba) tea - only to discover her new Dessert Playland is devoid of her favorite sweet treat. We're talkin' about all types of bubble tea, including mixtures with different flavored jellies. We're talking Boba Heaven. So, imagine the vast disappointed of said Young Woman when she realizes she's traded her Asian District fare and Boba for Mexican Food Mecca and Horchata.

Food; Coffee & Tea,Oz1w_3Ck8lalmtxPcQMOIA,Eba Cafe,26,4.5,4.57,5,"I've been a regular customer at the EBa! Cafe for years.  I take everyone I know here to try it!

Best Product:
Their drinks, by far.  My favorites are their flavored iced teas with boba.  The coffee drinks are good, but with all the good coffee shops in Tempe, I'd never pass up an opportunity to get a boba tea here.

What is BOBA?
If you've never had boba, then here's what you're missing-- you basically get a large scoop of oversized tapioca balls stirred into your drink.  They settle to the bottom, where it looks like you've got brown bubbles sitting at the floor of your cup.  As you slurp through your oversized straw, they come up with the iced tea, drumming at the roof of your mouth so you have to stop and chew every now and then.  They're the consistency of little drowned gummi bears, and can seem VERY weird at first, but if you're open-minded enough to try it, you might get hooked.  (I was determined not to like them, at first.  I got to the point where I went back twice a day to get more.)  They're completely vegan and don't taste much like anything on their own.  After a few minutes, though, they start to absorb the flavor in the iced tea around them.  So, it's like getting a drink and a snack in one.  Be careful not to take them home and refrigerate them overnight, though... they tend to dry out in the middle.

Heads up to new boba drinkers:
The cup will come to you with a sealed plastic top (to prevent spillage).  Don't try to peel it off... it's really stuck on there.  Just use your straw to punch a hole in the top of it.  That's what they're made for.  Be careful picking it up after that, though... the cups are sometimes thin enough to squeeze when you grab them, forcing the tea up through the new straw hole and all over you.  Take a few slurps before trying to move it around.

Flavors and Mixers:
All iced teas start with either a green tea or a black tea base.  After that, you choose your flavors to add.  My favorites are the peach, chai spice, ginger spice, pumpkin spice (seasonal), wintermelon, almond, chocolate, and sometimes banana milk.  The good thing is that the menu suggestions are just recommendations... you can custom-mix your flavors however you want them.  For the drinks that require milk, they use either soy or almond milk (I don't remember which), so even non-dairy folks can enjoy the whole range of flavors.  You can also substitute honey for the sweet syrup mixer, or even just opt out of the sweeteners altogether.  They'll prepare it however you like it.

Other menu options:
* In the middle of a Phoenix summer, their ice crushes and snow bubbles are amazing.  They basically take their boba teas and turn them into boba icees, with the same range of flavors available.  The ice crushes are without ice cream; the snow bubbles are with ice cream.
* Their hot teas (not used with boba) are loose-leaf scoops in very cool little decanters, but they only have a few different kinds of tea to choose from.
* Coffees and coffee drinks are very good.
* Gelato is tasty.
* The shaved ices are the same as I remember them from childhood, but I didn't like the red beans added to it.  They got too mushy and flavorless compared to the icy goodness around it.
* The brick toasts are wonderful, and the other food usually comes in small portions, so they're good for a snack.
* I don't think they mind if you bring in food from other establishments, as long as you patronize their business and clean up after yourself.

Service:
Suzi, the owner, is amazing.  She's in there all the time and is extremely friendly and helpful.  The other employees she hires all stay around for a while, which means that they enjoy working there.  They all know what they're doing and will re-make your order if they screw it up.  Not that they ever have!  They're wonderful!

Decor:
Their new-ish location on Broadway doesn't have the same mom-and-pop homemade feel that their old location on Forest did, but it's clean and cute, anyway.  There is seating available at tables, at the counter, or on couches in the front lounge area.  There is a TV in there that is sometimes on, so it can either be a good place to study or way too distracting, depending on your timing.  They'll turn the TV off if you ask.  Wireless is free for customers, but not for leeches.

Specials and discounts:
* There is a box of ""buy-10-get-1-free"" cards by the cash register.  If you get hooked, you'd be amazed at how quickly those go by.
* Sometimes, there are coupons on the rack inside the Sub Factory, which is in the same shopping center, a few doors down.
* There are also seasonal coupons online at: http://www.ebacafe.com/

What I would change:
* I'd love to see a decaf iced tea available for mixing.
* I'd love to have more comfy lounge space and fewer fluorescent lights (the only reason they keep them on is to follow safety codes until they get new lighting installed).",9rZ1DWzXRH3RcLoCj5U6_Q

The little details here struck me as legit.  

* The boba flavors and extras are extensive - probably about 50 or so different flavors and way to order. I opted for the vanilla green tea complete with little tapioca balls at the bottom, which satiated my (at the time) liquid diet.
* Hot food lunch offerings. When I met Gabi and other Yelpers I noticed I could have even had a full-on rice chicken curry lunch.  
*  But the icing on the cake was the karaoke set in the corner.  Hellz YES, how authentically Asian -- Karaoke when you're sober!!

Hot Lips!!  Ouch! 

Wow, I've not had a chance to try Dutch Bros before after driving by them many times due to the long lines.  Last week I wasn't in a rush so I pulled in behind four other cars thinking my wait for caffeine would be a while. To my surprise the wait was only 5 mins! The barista dude talked me into trying their monthly special, Irish Latte ~ silky blend of Irish Cream, milk and coffee.  I ordered it sugarless with 2%, no problemo.  The service was excellent! Fast, friendly and he gave me a frequent flyer card for my future trips. He explained how they roast their own coffee and they offer lots of other options ~ smoothies, soda's and juice.

My coffee smelled awesome and I could not wait to take a sip.  But wait a minute... Apparently Dutch Bros uses a coffee cup lid I'm not familiar with.  I looked at it and immediately thought about my son's ""sippy cup"" when he was a toddler.  This thing has a ""nipplessense"" feature about it that has a large hole!  So I stared at it for a while and starting laughing my face off, LMFO, and thinking about two iconic actors of the early 90's that imparted so much wisdom on our youth at that time ~ Beavis and Butthead!  

Beavis: ""that coffee lid looks like my old sippy cup""
Butthead: ""what do you mean?""
Beavis: ""it has a nipple...""
Butthead: ""uh huh huh huh.. you said nipple, uh huh huh huh...""

After I regained my composure, I smiled really big and took a sip of my Irish Latte from Dutch Bros. Ouch! Hot Lips! It took me a little while to figure out how to drink my coffee without burning my lips in this coffee lid.  The coffee was smooth with the perfect balance of sugarless Irish Cream and 2%. It was wonderful!  After it cooled down a bit I was able to enjoy my latte without burning my lips on the ""sippy cup"" lid. The large hole in the top of the lip was made for peak coffee guzzledge, after it cools down : -)",YLE6GoJ61fb0QBF7JTkaJg

After beginning a Starbucks Boycott last year (they used powdered coffee in just about everything other than their brewed coffee) I was starting to get lonely. 
On our way to Matt's Big Breakfast, my mother and I pulled in to Dutch Bros so I could try it out. It's right on my mum's way to work, and she recommended the four-shot Double Torture. It's like crack in a cup - in a good way.
I've since waned from my usal 4DT, but you know what I like about Dutch Bros, even more than the coffee? The service. I do not mind paying a little extra when I get treated the way I do at Dutch Bros.

Oh, and they have a (drum roll please)... A PUNCH CARD THINGIE! 
For every ten coffees you buy (no matter the size) you get a little neat-o stamp on your card and after the ten, you get one (whatever size) FOR FREE!!!!!! FREE!!! FREE!!!!

The coffee aint bad. Is it Cartel? Is it Lola? Is it Lux? Where else are the kids getting their coffee these days? No it is none of those. It only has a drive through remember? What the hell do you expect? Ya know what though? It truly aint bad. I like it and I drink it black. I do not find it to taste watered down like a lot of people have said and I hold to the last step of a recipe for coffee that I heard somewhere: ""if the horseshoe sinks drink it"". 

The people who work here are on drugs. I mean like in a metaphorical way of course; not in a slander sort of way. They are perky and friendly as shit. Admittedly, there is an irony in the fact that some mornings you just can't handle that level of friendliness before your coffee. 

My dog goddamn loves it here though. The pretty, little, young girls go ape-shit over him and give him dog biscuits and pats on the head and kisses right on his wet dog nose. At no other drive through will he go as tongue-hanging, tail-wagging crazy, trying to get into the drive through window to love up on those PYTs.  Anyone that is cool to my dog is cool with me.

On rare occasion when I feel no need whatsoever to prove how manly I am by ordering my coffee like I like my women: strong and black; I will order their sweet drinks. Oh man....This is their specialty for sure. Willy Wonka wakes up with this stuff.

They do it right. They do it quick. Perfect on the go cup o joe. (Goddamn I should write t shirt slogans.)",6WrOT1dj6sigl_voiwQ7HA

Oh, and if you want actual coffee, go elsewhere. They serve mostly sugar-filled concoctions that you can't even taste the coffee, and I can tell that my 'buzz"" is not a coffee buzz, it's a sugar high complete with awful crash.

First off, if you are looking for a good cup of coffee, then you should definitely give this place a try.  They have tons of great varieties... I prefer their Irish Cream variation.  It is lip-smacking delicious!

Two mild things I would also like to bring up... First, their coffee is slightly overpriced.  I feel that I am at a Starbucks competitor with how much their Iced Coffee costs.

Second, they pour their Iced Drinks from a pitcher... Now, I cannot verify how long the coffee had been in said pitcher, but it doesn't look the greatest when they grab a cup and pour the $4.00 drink right in front of you, taking less than 5 seconds to do so.

I work fulltime and go to school fulltime and maintain a semi normal life. And now I really have to up my caffeine dosage because I have finals. Actually, I have a final Saturday which I am cramming for. After a long day of work and hard work out session I decided I needed a caffeine boost so I could go home and study. I recalled reading about some ER 911 drink at Dutch Bros, and the article mentioned something about making even people with high caffeine tolerances feeling cracked out from the drink. So it sounded exactly  like what I needed. Driving to Scottsdale and McDowell I was looking so forward to this drink- in hopes it would really help me study and get a lot done. I pull up to blasting music and friendly service. I get even more excited. I order the drink. He asks me if I want it hot, iced, or blended. Seeing as it was hot out( I think it got over 100 degrees today) the blended sounded delightful. But, my health nuttiness kicked in and I asked how much worse the drink was for me. And the fit healthy looking guy assured me it was about the same as getting it iced. I was a little surprised but believed him. He handed me the drink and asked how I liked it. I took a sip, and I am not going to lie, it was delicious at the beginning. I took my second sip.. And thought to myself, this was too good to be true. As I neared my home and being about a quarter of the way done with my drink (16 oz) I felt so ill. I never feel sick from food or drinks (even alcohol!). I stuff my face and get that sick overly full feeling. This was way worse. I could barely get to my bed. I was sweaty, felt like vomiting everywhere. I felt like I had food poisoning. Finally, after half an hour of lying in bed and feeling sick, I told myself I needed to find out what was in this drink that has made me feel so sick. So, I looked up the nutrition and found that this drink was one of the WORST drinks nutritionally on the menu which aggravates me beyond belief because I SPECIFIALLY asked. The drink really is a ER 911 because it made me feel so sick I wanted to go to the ER. But, I am convinced it was bad milk or something because I have never felt so sick from a drink before. Plus, I am beyond mad that I asked the nutritional value of something and the incompetent barista assured me it was the same- what an idiot! Especially when it wasn't hard for me to look online.. I am sure they have little brochures in the store!
I do not recommend this place at all! And, after looking at all the other drinks nutritional values, they are all pretty bad for you! Compared to Starbucks and Dunkin...

Well, while my mom was at the bank across the parking lot I decided to stop in...err...""drive in"" for a latte. As far as the place itself there's not much say really. It's drive-thru only. Well, I shouldn't say that, there is a walk-up window, which is something I appreciate since I'm impatient and if I came here regularly and saw a line of cars I would take advantage of this. Also, the baristas here are ridiculously nice! They were smiling and cracking jokes while I was there, and if they're able to keep that up for an entire shift more power to them! 

As far as the latte itself, it was good! That's actually saying a lot for me since I'm generally NOT a fan of espresso-based drinks at smaller coffee shops (I have no shame in admitting I go to Starbucks regularly). 

One minor complaint I have about this place (but this isn't the reason I'm knocking a star)...and this is something that annoys me about coffee shops that do this in general, is the setup of the menu. I can appreciate giving drinks cutesy names & mixing interesting flavors that people normally wouldn't' think to order, but what about actually listing simply ""latte"" or ""Americano"" on the menu as well?

Dutch Bros. Coffee was founded by 2 brothers, who happen to have a Dutch heritage. 
My kinsmen, both geographically and nordicly:)
They are from, of all places, Grants Pass, Oregon (do not snooze on the drive up I-5 or you will miss Grants Pass...actually, don't snooze while you're driving that section of I-5...you'll drive off a mountainside and miss some of the most spectacular scenery in the United States, because you'll have crashed).
Dutch Bros. are still headquartered in Grants Pass.

Boy, do we know our coffee in the great northwest, or what (oh I know, I haven't lived up there for 15 years and it takes a threat of physical force to get me to go back to the ranch these days, but I still like to claim the place for something more than the rain:)
After my run this morning, I had to go pick up my mail (and can anybody tell me why they moved my PO Box from the very convenient Osborne location to North Tempe?...it's about a 45 minute drive down there and back).
And what do you want more than anything else after running 5 miles in 90 degree heat? That's right...a cup of piping hot coffee.
I pulled into the drive through and said ""set me up"", then I got to the speaker and had to say it again.
They got my coffee right the first time (right sweetener, right cream...it's why I almost never use drive through for coffee, but these guys made me happy).
And best of all, it's good coffee!
They don't seem to have a place to hang out and read your electro-mail or write your novel on your laptop (remember, the Dutch bros. are no-nonsense Oregon logging country boys...hard to read your electro-mail while you're dragging a Douglas fir out of the woods and your laptop is actually the top of your lap, but you do need decent coffee when you're getting up at 3:00 am to go to work).
But I see you can get out of your car and walk up to the window and get your coffee and sit at a table outside...but with a long drive back to Old Town Scottsdale, I just didn't have time.

I do not like the fact it is drive thru only and that you can't go in and sit down. Isn't that what a coffee shop is supposed to be? Most importantly, I just do not like their product.

I have tried 2 of their infusion teas and their chai tea latte. The first tea I tried was a green tea mixed with blackberry and pomegranate syrups. I thought it was very watered down and didn't taste sweet enough. The second tea was also a green tea but had raspberry and pomegranate syrups. This tea was too sweet and just not good. I went again and decided to get their chai tea, which is my favorite tea, and was extremely underwhelemed. It tasted like their was NO chai tea at all, absolutely no spice whatsoever...all I could taste was the milk and maybe a little honey. Honestly, it was the worst chai tea latte I've ever had!

Having a coffee shop within walking distance of my place is a must, and so after moving to Phoenix I was thrilled to have this cute little spot just up the road. 

I find that whenever I'm in the mood (or desperate) for a nice cup of coffee they're closed. Closed on Mondays. Closed after 3. Randomly closed today (Tuesday). On the occasions when I've ventured in and found them open, my experience has been ok. There's something about the ambiance that--and another reviewer mentioned it--feels awkward. Sometimes the music is too loud and I can't work, or the place is empty and I feel guilty about sitting for a couple hours and ordering just a coffee and some toast.

I think the staff (it looks like they might all be related) have been huffing toxic fumes in the kitchen.  The braincells were severely lacking throughout the place.  

I went there for breakfast, but I don't eat eggs and I don't drink coffee...this has never been a problem at any restaurant in the world...except for Drip.  They couldn't comprehend that I don't eat eggs...so basically I was ordering a breakfast sandwhich they had on the menu minus the egg (bread & ham).  This caused a 4-minute confused slo-mo conversation at the table and then the chef ( mom?) came out 5 minutes later and we had to do the the entire conversation again.  All of which was entirely unnecessary, but heaven forbid they make a lunch item for breakfast...even though the components are exactly the same and lunch started in 20 minutes.

The tea tasted average, but came in this time-consuming, over-the-top delivery system that was completely unnecessary.  It took forever for the simple-minded server to put it all together.  The server also liked hanging out at our table looking at us during our entire meal and taking things we weren't done with yet...like my half of my drink.

This was one of the most annoying dining experiences I've ever had.  Pretentious, snotty, AND simple-minded...weird!  At least when I got my food (which was still totally wrong, but it didn't have egg in it and I didn't want to talk to anyone there anymore so I ate it) it tasted good for what it was (wrong).

(ie - its not supposed to taste bitter and make your face scrunch up in pain).

for a coffee shop this is just unexcusable and grants no second chances. i hope that the owner is reading this cause i do want to see them succeed and i hope that she sees this as constructive criticism.

She said ""let's just get your drink order first"".  15 minutes later, I ordered a sandwich.  55 minutes after I walked in, I was eating my sandwich.

What?  

I stopped over because I had about an hour to kill.  You think that'd be enough time to get a sandwich and chill out.  Not that day.  The barista informed me they were short-handed.  

The sandwich I ordered, had I made it at home, would have taken about 10 minutes.

it's one of those coffee shops where you can sit and work, but there's also usually an opportunity or two every hour to jump into a convo that starts between the barista and the patrons and spreads around the cafe like a friendly communal blanket.  not that people are talking loudly - it's just a small space, so you'll be able to hear what everyone is saying unless they are speaking quietly.

the espresso is yummy.  note to the guy who got gas from an actual chai tea - that's how a chai latte is supposed to be made, man.  it's like complaining because someone gave you fresh juice instead of juicy juice.

also, the bathroom area is awesome!  i don't know why.  i just really like it.

fair warning: the chairs are not very comfy.  even the ones in the middle of the room.  which look like they are begging to hold your fanny in a warming canvassed embrace - they leave you cold and a little stiff.",d2RAl63RTdfZF7kcuKcj-g

There are only a handful of tables (all two tops) but they don't mind if you pull them all together for a group. Just be prepared. The kitchen is not known for being speedy, but that's part of Drip's appeal. Sit back, relax, enjoy your coffee and conversation while you wait for you food to come out. It's worth the wait. 

I've only been for breakfast and I really like the veggie fritatta (usually has asparagus, mushrooms and red/green bell peppers) with a few dollops of sour cream baked in. It comes with a piece of the BEST toast in the world with homemade berry jam. I have to remember to ask next time where they get that bread. The toast and jam also is a great breakfast treat.. 

They brew up fresh tea for you when you order ice tea. It's served with the hot cup of tea still steeping and a cup full of ice at the ready. They also offer Italian sodas in a bunch of different flavors and, of course, coffee.

i find it totally lame.
if you thought my organic food was bland, i'd much rather you tell me, talk to me about it so i could attempt to make it non bland for you....i wonder what you ordered?
no you have to spew negativity into the world.
curious if i was the barista that made your carmel latte???
regardless if you care enough to come back to drip i'll attempt to make you a beverage that suits your tastes.

I met Gina Madrid, the owner, and we bonded over growing up in West Phoenix.  She was so nice and easygoing, it felt more like chatting with an old friend rather than buying an americano and cupcake.  I almost forgot to pay, and she almost forgot to charge me!

Speaking of the cupcakes:  they are deeeelicous and vegan.  I had the PB & J cupcake and it was like heaven.  Moist, creamy, and sweet all at the same time.  She said that the guy who bakes them just walked in one day and offered to let her try some of his wares.  He used to bake them at his house, but Gina liked them so much she offered to let him use her kitchen at the Lounge.  They are really really good. 

I like the minimalist decor and the fact that Gina doesn't want to display art.  Normally I would hate this, but Gina makes a great argument for having a nice blank space to clear your thoughts. Plus it can be a hassle to manage the selling of art and finding artisits that you want to sell for.

My visit was less than thrilling, however.  I must pretense my review with the fact that I'm a purist, a little bit of a snob and opinionated.  I can appreciate tea blends - I make certain ones myself.  They serve a place and a purpose.  That said, I expect to be able to buy pure loose tea leaves at a place specializing in tea.  In fact, you'd think that's the main focus of a tea shop, but here it seems blends and spices are what keeps things together.

They have lots of ""teas"" and accessories.  Maybe blends and masking tastes is what the public wants - I have no idea.  I do know that I'd think even a medium shelf, quality estate leaf would be available (or rather, the focus) at a tea shop.  I know you've seen shops like Adagio - you have their products.  When I heard this place opened, I thought it could be the first and only in PHX to really hit the nail on the head.  C4 still remains the place to go in a pinch; at least there I can get something called ""darjeeling"" (even if that's almost as vague as calling it ""Chinese black tea"").",hVkQbDk61hmIi5iVm3IkZw

Theoretically, I know I should be take advantage of the cooler morning temperatures and mow my lawn, but that's what Sundays are for, right? If you ask me, Saturday mornings are much better suited for relaxing and sipping coffee. Thankfully, I live just down the street from Copper Star Coffee (and luckily for my dog, Copper Star is right next door to Wag 'n Wash). The setup of this place is perfect, super cute converted gas station, and plenty of space on the patio for my pup to play greeter. You can get pretty much any kind of coffee/espresso drink you like, but I really dig the plain 'ol brewed coffee. Oh, and don't get me started on the tasty treats ogling me from their strategic position inside the glass case.

I like it's visually uniqueness.

I ordered my regular ice coffee with measured instructions and it tasted typically good like from other coffee places I've visted. What I enjoyed even more was the atypical meal offering; a big curry chicken sandwich, my first experience. Their service was excellent as they brought my items to my table and they gladly answered questions about the experience and product offering of this place. 

The wifi was very reliable. I was able to get a lot of work done on my laptop during the many hours I was there and ordered more items. I think that is attributable to the very quiet atmosphere of the place, too quiet for me as I hardly hear anyone have any converstation and I didn't feel comfortable about talking on my phone here.

Room For Improvement: The coffee was decent...it was good...but I was hoping for outstanding. I prefer a stronger, smokier roast. Also, the wi-fi was deplorable. It was beyond intermittent--it would be on for one minute, then off for 5. Very frustrating.

Overall: If they improved their internet, and I ordered stronger drinks from them, then Copper Star is/would be the perfect coffee shop.

I dig Copper Star -- good coffee, friendly crew, a drive through. Heck, one time, I even got a free Powerball ticket there.

I only have one quibble, and it's a small one. I only mention it because I care. It's the excessive and cheesy signage.

I liked the little hand-painted sandwich board, that read, ""drink local coffee."" It fit perfectly with their local business vibe.

Now that sign has been repainted in a more generic manner, and moved to the side. In its stead is a gigantic white vinyl banner, on it, printed in stark, black, all caps ""DRIVE THRU COFFEE.""

Gag. 

So now there's the generic sandwich board, the huge banner, the flappy flags, and the neon in the window. 

I understand that they are trying to increase business. But now it's looking like a used car lot, and reeks of desperation. People don't like to patronize desperate business, because it's sad, and makes them feel sad too.

Please, Copper Star, dial it down a notch. Share your message with confidence, but without shouting. We will still love you!

There isn't a ton of parking, but there is plenty of places to park on the street.

Older people relax with a cup of coffee with their dog on a leash at this kind of place.  Younger hipsters hang out inside on their mobile devices at this kind of place.  The garage door was open, so a cool morning in Arizona could be enjoyed by everyone.  The couches inside were precariously cushy as they engulf you when you sit down.

The cookie I ordered as a dessert to breakfast was still warm when it was served to me.  The chocolate chips were gooey and soft, and it was practically right out of a commercial, with a slow camera pan on my hands as I ripped a chunk off with a rivulet of milky chocolate stretching away.  The coffee was not burnt-tasting or overly bitter, and was probably the best I had on my trip.

And everyone who worked there was polite and friendly.  Several of them took the time to address my questions about the area, and if they had any suggestions of anything to do, whether it was in the city or out in Surprise where I was headed.

This place is, by far, my favorite new discovery in ages.  I've been driving past it on my way to and from work for ages but never had the time to stop in.  I have friends who rave about the place and go regularly, so I really wanted to check it out.  I finally did this past Saturday (5/31) and I scolded myself for not having done so sooner.

My friend and I found a parking space out back in the tiny parking lot and walked in not really knowing what to expect.  One patron sat at a table with her laptop and the rest of the place was empty.  The friendly girl at the counter took our orders and gave her own recommendations for cool drinks.  I took her up on her suggestion of a peach smoothie.  It was wonderful - like drinking pureed peaches!  I took a sip of my friend's latte and knew I would be ordering one of my own at some point in the near future.  Before taking our drinks, my eyes lingered over the cupcakes on display; I must admit I drooled a bit.

Because it was such a nice night, we sat outside and enjoyed our drinks.  It wasn't long before more people showed up.  A group of older folks joined us outside and a few other groups and couple settled inside.  My mind kept going back to the cupcakes I saw earlier, and I ended up going inside to buy one.  My choices were vanilla, red velvet, lemon, and strawberry (I think).  Not only were the cupcakes quite sizeable, but they had sprinkles - goldfish and piggies!  Very nice touch.  I ended up selecting a vanilla funfetti cupcake with bright blue icing and goldfish sprinkles.  It wasn't anything spectacular - just a cupcake made from a box cake mix - but it was a very nice treat and that much more special due to the fishies.  I know - it doesn't take much to make me happy.

I've since been back twice and have used the very convenient drive-thru.  The first time, the man who came out to greet me asked if I had my stamp card after he took my order.  When I told him I didn't, he told me he would give me one, and he did - along with three stamps!  that morning I had another peach smoothie and decided to try the red velvet cupcake.  The smoothie was just as ood as the first, but this cupcake was VERY tasty - much better than the vanilla funfetti.  I stopped again this morning and ordered a vanilla latte.

I loved all their different seating, the vintage cash register and even one of the coolest bathrooms I've ever been in, but if I'm going to pay nearly $5 for a 16oz drink, I want it to taste amazing.

Songbird's been frickin' killin' it with a PERFECT, CONSISTENT spicy chai (make it dirty) and then there's my home coffee shop: Copper Star.  

Ooooooooooh, Copper Star, how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways. Their drinks are great.  They showcase local art.  The music is good.  Their baristas are genuinely nice people.  Seriously.  I might hug one of them next time I go in.  But it's the FOOD that prompted this post.  Today I discovered their vegan, gluten-free, peanut-butter oatmeal cookies.  I know there are people out there that imagine that vegan and gluten free can't possibly be good, but I honest-to-god believe that the 3 (maybe 3? Maybe 20?) minutes I spent enjoying that cookie may have been some of the best minutes of my life.  I can't really pin down how long it was, because I'm pretty sure that cookie helped me transcend space and time.  SO. Good.

Food; Coffee & Tea,jCUOqEK8Lln0PK3GeUl6IQ,Copper Star Coffee,201,4,3.65,2,"No. No. No.

I want to like it. I tried to like it. The location is super convenient. It's in a restored gas station. The set up inside is cute. I could/should totally study and/or work here. I want to like it.... Really, I do. The staff is nice. I like the patio outside. Parking is easy...

But NO. I waited on reviewing Copper Star, each visit hoping that it would be different than the last, but I can't ignore things like....well, the drinks. 

Two BIG things I don't like:

1. Fundamentally, the drinks are never very good. The milk is either scalded, as if someone didn't get the message that milk temperature rises after you turn the steam wand off. When you have to double cup a breve, that means you screwed up and should make it again - I should not have to feel the cup, knowing it will taste scalded only to take a sip and hand it back to you. Also, espresso shots need to be pulled accurately when you are using a manual machine - preferably between 18-24 seconds if your have things calibrated right. When a shot sits there forever while you get your shit together, steam the milk, or generally mess around - it loses its body and begins a quick descent into the realm of bitterness. That happens a lot here. You can't get an americano. No crema. It just looks burned out - because the shots sat there forever or were never pulled correctly in the first place. 

2. The place looks fine at first glance, but the floors are always dirty, the counters and condiment bar have never been wiped down while I have been inside, and the steaming pitchers don't look like they get a thorough rinse after each usage. I notice these things and they bother me.

That being said, it's not awful. I would just rather go to Lux, Lola, Citizen, Giant, or even Starbucks. I want to love it here, but it's more like Urban Beans over on 7th Street - they both get your hopes up and don't deliver.",NqeD28GGg1Wdj9BfaHqr4g

Then it's time to get re-train some of these workers to be more customer oriented because they're losing focus. They're talking loud on the phone while on shift - pretty much everyone in the place could hear her business.

The coffee was ""ok"" nothing too special - I like that bitter/sweet taste in my drink, but that wasn't present.

Yes really!

I got a ride here while my friend did a study group at ASU so I could give Lux a break and got down to laptopping and reading after buying a very good decaf soy latte. I settled down into my table and noticed the place didn't have a lot of buzz for a Friday during the day. 

About two hours into my work, a woman came in for a book signing wearing an unironic fanny pack and I moved so she could have the table.

Then I moved to the sofa but was distracted by the perfectly coifed guy on the sofa wearing a silk button down shirt a la most graduation photos circa 1993 kept muttering to himself how to improve his writing quite theatrically. 

I moved to another table when my laptop needed another boost from the outlet but then had a very harley davidson old man with what seemed like his granddaughter but looked like a runaway from Suicide Girls, pre-teen edition (she was wearing short shorts with thigh high socks and a big baggy sweatjacket-it was like 30 degrees out!) sat at the end while waiting for their orders to come though.

Finally, I ended up in the corner red chair to plug in again and my friend met up and we got another coffee and a snack. By that point, the place was starting to get packed and a family now at the table literally in front of me, the guy kept talking about his body-building competition, what he knew about computers, hooters (to which he talked about to his wife's PARENTS) forever forever forever forever....

We had to go after that and escaped to Lux.

The place itself is fine, the coffee and treats have been solid, but the people here are really distracting to me-therefore, it drops a star as a place to concentrate and do work.

I can't offer feedback on the coffee because I'm a tea drinker.  It's the monster, refillable iced teas that keep me coming back.  They have several to choose from, and are very generous with the servings.  This is a very good thing in the summer time.  

The pastries are freakin' awesome.  Love the baked goods, except maybe for the bagels.  They're just ok.  Otherwise, if you love a great muffin, they have 'em.

The lunch items are a weak point.  I've eaten lunch here a few times, and I was never satisfied on any occasion.  The first time, they didn't have the ingredients necessary to make the meal, and tried to concoct some frankenwich that was just odd.  I ended up swapping it out for hummus plate that was just- meh.

Despite being in a converted gas station/garage, the atmosphere is quite a bit more cozy than most of the other coffee shops in central Phoenix.

Though the last time I was at Copper Star I did find the two gals working to be kind of rude, which was odd considering any other time I have been there the service has always been friendly. 
I do think parking is a major pain. Their parking lot accomdates two to three vehicles after that you will have to park in the neighborhood in front of someone's house.

Part of the reason to head to Copper Star is the ambiance: it's a converted vintage gas station with a quirky, welcoming feel. Light streams in through the glass-paneled garage door and, with the cafe's tall ceilings, the space feels at once very large and very cozy. I've come here to work the past, but unlike some coffee shops, Copper Star is never completely overrun by laptops. There are always pairs or groups of friends here having a good time. Nevertheless, if productivity is what you want, the shop is never too loud, there's free WiFi, and there are a couple plugs along the west wall. I've definitely had some productive afternoons tinkering away at one of their long communal tables. 

The quality of service at Copper Star has consistently been excellent. The folks are nice, approachable, and ready to help, and interacting with them has always been a joy. The coffee is good -- I'm a no-fuss, black coffee girl, but trust them about the iced cappuccino on really hot days -- and, if you're more of a tea person, they're one of the few places nearby that stock Harney & Sons, one of my favorite tea blenders in the US. I've had a couple pastries and the veggie sandwich, and they were delicious.

I went to Copper Star Coffee to get my drink of choice, an iced coffee with cream.  I enjoyed the flavor.  It was better than Starbucks and quite a few cents cheaper.  SCORE!!!  I became a regular.  I stuck with my ice coffee for months but their bakecase was calling my name every time I would enter.  I found out Copper Star bakes their own pastries fresh daily.  Another SCORE!!!  No preservatives or high fructose corn syrup.  I started adding a scone with my iced coffee.  They have chocolate chip, lemon, blueberry, etc.  Delicious!!!  The apple sauce spice cake is now my favorite.  It is a vegan pastry.  It is flavorful and the glaze is so slight but fantastic.  Not a vegan by the way.  

I have been slowly branching out among the Copper Star menu.  Try the Black Cherry Limeade.  The specialty coffee drinks are quite good too.  The blended toffee drink rocks.  The antioxidant smoothie is refreshing.  The other smoothies are okay.  They use syrup in those.  I don't know how healthy that makes them.  (Real fruit please).

Let's talk about their sandwiches now shall we.  I have tried their sesame tuna, the curry chicken, the deviled egg salad, and the veggie.  All of them are winners.  You wont be disappointed.  Copper Star just unveiled there new sub sandwiches as well.  They use a local butcher's sausages for their subs.  Awesome.  Way to keep it in the community.

Nor can anyone  match  the friendliness and unpretentiousness of the staff. 

 I have only tried the scones and muffins.   Scones are a difficult feat in most places but Copper Star has some of the tastiest.  Try the chocolate chip or cranberry walnut scone.   During the fall they make homemade pumpkin muffins  (using fresh pumpkin) that are to die for.  They run out so fast you have to get there early.  I wish they would offer these year round.Yum!

$2.50 for my iced Americano - just like the menu said it would be. Of course, I had to ask where the menu was - amusing. My Americano was spot-on. I barely had to add any milk or sugar.

Such a small space with hardly any parking whatsoever. Inside, very little options when sitting. No, I don't want to sit on a wooden chair for over 2 hours, thanks. Wish this place had more plush seats. 

Decor is cool and relaxing. Really liked the layout and I found the bathroom to be even cool. Go fig. Service was prompt and friendly.

That said, I have to confess: I've never actually had coffee here. You see, I'm a Trader Joe's gal. I buy my Trader Joe's roast [well, actually Ken buys it, I don't do grocery shopping any more], bring it home, set up the timed Mr. Coffee [well, actually Ken does that for me too--don't all you chicks out there wish you had MY husband???] and it turns on at 6 am. By the time I'm done with my health walk, it's brewed and waiting for me.

So you all are no doubt wondering just why is this crazy NDN woman reviewing a coffee shop where she's never had the coffee? Because, amigos...it's because Coffee Star is one of my favorite lunch spots. It's in the Melrose District, also one of my faves [I have a biggg article coming out in Valley Guide Quarterly to prove it!], their sandwiches are OK [not 100 percent, more like 80 percent but that's ok], the building is just the coolest old gas station-cum-coffee shop EVER and did this, kemosabes...

THEY HAVE REAL COKE!! That's right, caballeros, they have Mexican Coca-Cola, the old recipe with real sugar instead of the corn syrup that Coke so-calls sweetens their colas with. That along is worth driving over for...

And it's a great spot to hang and watch the world go by. One of these days I'll try out the wi-fi and try to resolve that issue....",Aggpf1EWooD85fhOhoRxPg

The buildling is an old gas station I've driven by many times before ... never would I have thought that it would be creatively converted into a small sandwich and coffee shop... but I'm glad it did!

The small outdoor patio had a few people there (and some pets) and the indoor seating area was small but empty enough that we found quick seating.  The table/chairs were a bit awkward (a bit wobbly), but we made do.  We all had sandwiches (I the Curried Chicken Sandwich - how have I not had this before, it was outstanding in flavor!! and my sister's whose sam'ich I also tried was the Deviled Egg - also delicious) and afterwards we decided that, with the unique selection of alternative-ingredient baked goods they had on display, we'd try a few out.  

When we had first walked in, this girl's big, FAT delicious looking cinnamon roll had caught my eye.. and after lusting after it throughout my meal, I decided I'd go back to the walk-up counter and get us one to split... waa!

Although there is a Starbucks equipped with a drive through a mile north, I prefer to keep my dollars local and the fact that Copper Star has a drive through help me do just that. Each time I visit Copper Star, there is always something different in the way of pastries or muffins. On one visit in November they had scratch-made pumpkin and raisin muffins. I'm not a big fan of pumpkin in any form other than pie, but I over heard someone there mention they were really good. Being in a festive mood that day I bought one and was very pleased. As far as I know, everything is made in-house or is local. The Batista's pull a mean shot. When it's 110 degrees out, nothing tastes better than an iced double americano (no cream).

A grin spread across my face as I got first a touch of light airy foam, then rich milk, and finally the smooth taste of the espresso. I thought I would get used to this, but I've been going there for nearly a year, at times almost every morning, and no matter what I get from there, it puts a grin on my face (except the agave latte, I can't believe people drink that). Even the non-coffee-snobby drinks like the vanilla latte, the chai or the mocha are brilliant. I don't go in as often as I used to now, because I buy their beans and make my coffee at home, mimicking their setup as best as I can.

As far as the service, yes it's true, there is some times a bit of attitude, but quite honestly, you're paying a little more to get a skilled person to make you a delicious drink of the caliber you can only get at a select few places in the valley.

There's only two reasons that keep me from giving them 5 stars: the difficult to find location and the crappy wifi. Honestly, if the wifi rocked, that would probably be enough for me.

I call Cartel the ""accidental coffeehouse"". It started off as a roasting operation with a small espresso/retail component. Thanks to the ridiculously high quality of their coffee, they grew into a full-fledged coffeehouse.

The coffee Cartel roasts and brews is consistently some of the best in the valley. I am in love with their Black Market Espresso, which is a favorite of mine both at the shop and in the office when I brew my own.

Cartel provides all of the standard espresso beverages as well as iced toddy. However, they don't do any of the foofy blended drinks. Not only do I appreciate their commitment to classic coffee drinks, I also enjoy the freedom from hearing an insanely loud blender when I'm attempting to have a conversation.

There's also a couple of less common brewing methods available at Cartel. They have pour-over brewers which brew single cups. This enables them to offer any of their beans as fresh brewed coffee. Also, they have a Clover machine, which brews single cups on demand.

I do wish that Cartel served some pastries or other food, but Cartel is unabashedly committed to coffee, so I can't fault them for this.

The vibe at Cartel is a great mix of bohemian eclectic, which fits their proximity to ASU's main campus. The largely windowless interior makes it a great place to take refuge from the often brutal Arizona sun and enjoy a drink or two while hanging out with friends or getting work done.

Overall, Cartel is an excellent addition to the Phoenix coffee scene.",WxQysGZlxxfVXy73ldm5EA

Cartel Coffee Lab has to be one of the coolest spots in Tempe. It is appropriately named as a place that would foster an addiction, and addicted I now am. It has the definite feel of an old warehouse. It is dimly lit, has high, exposed rafters and cooling vents, a concrete floor, and a usable garage door at the back. The layout is great, with a bar, several couches, and a good number of tables fully wired with plugs for the mac or pc-wielding crowd. It's a funky place, very urban; the main room is separated by an art installation made of bike tire rims. Cartel seems to attract a hugely eclectic group of patrons, from unbathed hipsters to ASU students to very cool coffee snobs. I sat next to the most interesting man, definitely a regular, and learned that he owns the old flour mill on Mill Ave! He also shared the most delicious almond cookie with me, baked by his father. Very cool. 

Yes, the coffee. The coffee and espresso are fantastic. People complain that the service is slow, but calmatevi amici, they are making the valley's best coffee, to order, and that takes time! Their beans are direct trade, roasted in house. Try the espresso - it's perfect. Regular coffee fan? They use the Clover, a single serve machine that makes every cup special, just for you. They will alternatively use this awesome manual system with paper filters to drip your coffee nice and slow. I like that they make you commit - large or small - and they keep their menu very simple, so you'll need to get your vanilla lattes elsewhere.

I wanted some hot tea to sooth the pain from the sandpaper I apparently swallowed in my sleep Friday night. The location had been previously decided, and only wonderful things were spoken about it, so off to Cartel we go.. 

This joint is hidden. Had I been driving, I probably would have missed it. Also the parking situation is shit. My friend and I had to guide a 16 year old girl in her mothers boat of a vehicle, out of her parking space to avoid hitting the car that was illegally parked behind her, only to be honked and screamed at by (insert ASU douchebag here). idiots. We did get her spot though, which was directly in front of the entrance. Score. Upon entering, there are piles and piles of fliers and random magazines and also a box of what looked like dirty purses, staplers and shoes. I have no idea.. Anyway, there is radical art work and a sculpture hanging from the ceiling made of bicycle wheels, which was awesome and I want one! Plenty of unique reading material - I opted for the Best of The Onion, also lots of tables and couches full of the entire Indie population of Tempe. Most of these people happen to be Mac users, clearly shop at thrift stores, listen to the M. Ward station on Pandora and wear retro headbands, so I cant really complain. I too use a mac, love thrifting, love that station and have a sweet headband collection myself, so I don't mind this Hippie-esqe crowd. However, some people do.. If that's you, go to the corporate whore known as Starbucks instead. So basically I love the interior and the people that convent here. However, It was about 300° inside. It may have been cooler outside, and we all know how f-ing hot it is right now.. There was no way I was about to order a steaming hot tea while perspiring heavily. Annoyed, I get an iced ""Happiness Blend"" tea, which totally defeated the purpose of soothing my throat, but the tea was nice.. perfectly minty with a hint of daffodil. Everyone tried their hardest to have a sit down and enjoy the effects of caffeine and good company, but it was just way too hot in there, and so we were forced to leave. This situation needs to be handled immediately, otherwise there is no way I can hang out here unless its in January. That's really the only thing I have to complain about. I didn't try any of their coffees, but it smelled wonderful and the foam art that was being created was lovely.. I don't know why, but I just enjoy my beverage all the more when there is a foam heart floating on the top.

The decor I thought was imaginative. The use of bike parts as a partition to keep the laptop users in the way back.. They have comfy sofas to lounge and talk. Plenty more tables in the front. The place overall was unique and clean. The music plays in the background, although a bit loud where it's tough to hold a conversation.

The beans for every cup of coffee are ground and drip brewed as you order, so you'll have to allow yourself a few minutes of anticipation. I would not recommend large groups of people either, as I believe there are only 4-5 brewing stations that can be used simultaneously. 
---Dark roasts are not served here, just light to medium.
---Fun fact: Darker roasts actually contain less caffeine than lighter roasts - not that you should interrupt your drinking pleasure with those kinds of thoughts...
---Cartel sells their own freshly roasted beans. It's pricey (somewhere around $15-20 for 3/4 lb), but you get what you pay for!
---Some eyebrows may be raised if you try to fluff up their drinks too much (fortunately the coffee is fantastic without the aid of double-shot-mocha-sugar-syrup potions).
---Cappuccinos will be enjoyed in house, in their proper glasses. They will not be put in ""to-go"" cups.
---Yes, there is free wi-fi for paying customers.
---They usually, though not always, have some yummy pastries...if you need something more substantial, please see below:
---Right across the parking lot is a great mom-and-pop pizza place called Otto's. Convenient for a limited lunch break! Also next to Buffalo Clothing Exchange, if want to make a day out of it...

Why only four stars, you ask? The general ambience of the place is a little too industrial for my taste, and in the past there have been some less than pleasant baristas. I'm happy to report, however, that in my last few visits I was served by wonderful people that were kind and helpful.

For the rest of us, I hate to pour cold coffee on the Cartel-parade, but I just am not feelin' the love. I ordered an iced cafe mocha. The resulting lukewarm concoction tasted like a very strong brew of chocolate-infused cardboard. *shiver* To tell you the truth, it was vaguely reminiscent of chicory coffee, which is not my ""cup of tea,"" so to speak. I even brought my younger, hipper friend to Cartel to make sure my evaluation was fair, and she now makes a face whenever I mention it!

Something was amiss especially since I drink so much damn coffee and refuse to go to that one chain. You know the one: starts with a Star and ends in Bucks and the word is Starbucks. Yeah, I don't care for their product. 

I have one criterion when trying a new coffee shop: espresso. Espresso is truly an art form, and when done well, is almost orgasmic (almost). When that espresso shot hit my mouth, omg! Incredible! It reminded me of rich dark chocolate, the kind not ruined with sugar, but delicious as nature intended it. The espresso was so different than what I expected or have ever had before. 

I liked the menu for its ease and simplicity. This is a coffee shop, not some fake coffee flavored sugar based beverage shop. The beans are always fresh since they are roasted in-house. And the beans are not burnt to a crisp like some places do. (You know who I'm talking about.)

The atmosphere was laid back, service was a little slow, but I wasn't in a rush. I've said it before: I don't like to feel like a number when I'm getting coffee, I don't want to feel like I'm being hurried out the door. So the slow service wasn't a negative for me.

I noticed that the water line that goes into the espresso machine hangs down from the ceiling in plain view, rather than being piped up from the floor. I'm not sure why I thought that was cool, but I did. 

The parking lot is a little hard to navigate because it's not that big. So be aware of that.

But fortunately, the service, coffee and consumables were excellent too, so it gets a five star from this traveler for the right reasons.

An easy-to-get-to location right off University, with a slightly cramped parking lot, but at least it's free, everything about Coffee Cartel Lab is pretty, well hip.  I particularly like the word ""cartel"" in the name, because it makes me feel like the caffeine I crave is like a Venezuelan drug and the coffee cartels are the only place I can acquire it.

But the interior is a tidal wave of hipster atmosphere, with dim lights, open ceilings, independent art all over the walls, flyers and cards for independent works free to peruse and browse, and pretty much every seat in the house taken up by someone with horn-rimmed glasses, tattoos, ironic t-shirts and skinny jeans, equipped with their iPhones, iPads or laptops, making full use of the wifi.  But it's still clean and cozy feeling, overall.  Oddly, to a jaded traveler like myself, as critical as I sound towards hipsters, the places they frequent are kind of the places I like to frequent...

Anyway, the mocha I ordered was creamy and just right, and I took great sadistic pleasure in purchasing the very last cookie that was this Frankenstein of chocolate chips, peanut butter AND BACON.  The bacon flavor was subtle, but still noticeable, and I took great pleasure of enjoying it in between sips of my mocha while trying not to inadvertently listen to young ASU students trying to give each other resume tips and advice.

Prices were standard faire, and really nothing different than you would expect from a Starbucks, or any other independent coffee shop these days.  I know for a fact that my travels would bring me out to Arizona again, and if presented the opportunity, I'd go back to the Cartel again without much problem.",PDpWGp4PVts0rxK_h_2ntg

Food; Coffee & Tea,lktu5JPDlQUG-7cV7gOzDQ,Cartel Coffee Lab,264,4.5,3.07,4,"I am not a huge coffee drinker, in fact I never drink plain coffee.  But, I have been wanting to go here since reading an article in the New Times a few years ago about the Clover machine, and how this place was one of the few places in the country that had one before Starbucks bought the manufacturer and ended the sale of the machine. 

Fast forwards to today:  I finally went to grab a bag for my girlfriend and roommate.  I hate the smell of crappy coffee being made in the morning and how it infects my entire house.  I can tolerate and even enjoy a nice bean.  After 3 or 4 trips in the area at night without the actual address, I came up empty handed because there is no sign on the street and it is hidden behind another building.  Finally I wrote down the address and managed to find it during the day.  

First impression:  There is a magnetic field that attracts a disproportionate amount of dirty ass, homeless-looking, transient-type folks.  If I owned the joint I would call in an exterminator and mobile pet groomer.  Spray pesticide on them to kill the fleas, and give them a full-service pet grooming which should include de-matting, shearing, a shampoo, tick collar, nail trim, and an ear cleaning.  My dog held his nose walking by these people.  

Maybe they have a must-have-showered-within-the-last-week rule for indoors because the clientele seemed more hygienic.  Minimal decorations, and it is very clear that they are not going to wow you with glitz, glam, christmas cd's or sizes that mean large in 3 different languages.  

Unlike many people on here, I actually was helped by a very friendly gentleman (w/ dreds).  He helped me choose a bag, and get me a drink to go.  I went iced latte to go (it was warm out) and got a Guatemalan bag for the coffee drinkers in the house.  My latte was unsweetened and quite tasty.  They have some very primitive-looking coffee brewing techniques and machines which are pretty cool.  All employees had a smile on their face, engaged in some small talk with a few people and promptly made my drink in a few minutes.  I don't know if they canned all the snotty employees or seeing someone that is 6'4"" brings out their nicer side.  I can only speak of my experience and it was short and sweet.

I would like to comment on  the most snotty-douche-y review I have ever read.  Note to Phoenicians, if you use the word CenPho, you are exhibiting tool-like behavior.  End of discussion.  If you look down your nose and say that a certain establishment does not belong in said CenPho because it isn't cool enough to be around you, you are moving towards the extreme side of the tool spectrum.  If you have to use profanity in a review you can add the title of tasteless.  My hunch is they saw Mr. Lord of Culture coming from a mile away.  You stay in CenPho and let us folks stay in a city and area without the need for catchy nicknames.  Oh yeah, the word poser died in the 90s, catch up.

So, I was in Tempe one day and searched for coffee places and decided to give Coffee Cartel a try. Let's just say....I'm now addicted! I want it everyday! They have the best mochas ever, hands down. And their cookies are to die for. mmmm...

I was a bit intimidated before I walked in because I had no idea what to expect. The building is in the back of the parking lot, no windows really and is just very inconspicuous. I walked in and the place was pretty packed. There are tables for people to sit at in groups of 4, some random chairs, even a hair dryer chair you see at the salon, and then two long tables with lots of outlets for computers. I love outlets!!!! The decor is very urban, concrete floors, open ceiling, garage door in the back. I loved it. Music is definitely not 'coffee-shop' music, but contemporary and up beat. Loved it as well!  

In the days  I spent there studying I got mochas, a few cookies and their dirty chai. I had no complaints about any of them. The mochas were actually pretty amazing and so were the cookies.

Food; Coffee & Tea,lktu5JPDlQUG-7cV7gOzDQ,Cartel Coffee Lab,264,4.5,3.74,5,"Well done, Cartel.  Well done!

I am in town for business, and needed a cup of coffee that is nearby.  Not having a rental car, I needed something within walking distance of my hotel ... who knew I would luck out and find this hidden gem so close! Not only was I very glad that I didn't have to fall back on my ""safety cup"" (SBUX - also nearby.  After all, when aren't they?) but I was very pleased with both the quality of the coffee as well as the friendliness of the barista.  (She happily shared that she and her sister had just returned from a barista competition in California and came back with not only some new tricks she was eager to try out, but a new-found love for her job.  Passion like this is rare, and I firmly believe is the secret ingredient to a successful cup of coffee).

My drink of choice is an americano with an extra shot, some cream and a couple raw sugars. (I know, I know... but hey, I like what I like!) That being said, it's also a risky choice. If the grind isn't right, I can often get stuck with an extra strong cup of undrinkable sludge.  My fears were quickly laid to rest as I took that first wonderful sip... Eureka!  Amazing.  

The only knock I would say is that they have the simple syrup for sweetening instead of granulated raw sugar (which is my preference). But, you know what?  That's the beauty of their shop... they do it their way. And the other thing?  While I was waiting for the bottle of syrup to be refilled, I snuck a sip without sweetener, and quickly realized I didn't need any sugar. It was silky smooth and wonderfully full flavored all on it's own (the way, I imagine, it's supposed to be, right?).  About the time I realized I no longer needed any sugar, she brought out the new bottle... and while feeling bad for making her go through the trouble for me, I passed on the sweetener and enjoyed the cup the way it was: perfect.  (I did pretend to put a couple pumps into the cup so she wouldn't feel like she did that for nothing.)

The atmosphere has a cool urban industrial vibe to it, and it really works.  The only bummer is that it was somewhat hidden and hard to find (nothing that pacing up and down University for a few minutes with my iPhone didn't fix, though).  But like wine is better for the struggle the grapes have to go through in the dry environment, this coffee tastes better because of the sense of adventure in finding it. Okay, now that may be a bit of a stretch, but it was definitely worth the little extra bit of effort to find it.  

I really like the name as well.  We all talk about caffeine as a drug, and the hardcore coffee drinkers (like myself) are addicted and willing to suffer less than ideal cups of ""coffee"" just to get our fix and avoid the dreaded headaches. So in a way, your barista is like your dealer... and their supplier?  The place they get their ""stuff""... a cartel.  Brilliant.

All in all, this is a great joint and I look forward to the next four mornings here in town, because I know where I'm getting my fix...",oKFqd2Lhz37jZQgI4gdbqA

The coffee is great.  Period.  They roast the beans themselves, know way too much about coffee and are proud.  The espresso, in whatever form you get it in, is rich and nutty.  The toddy (cold brewed iced coffee) is strong to the point of me jittering out the door from a small one.  The teas are various and steeped in a cool manner and timed according to their type.

The Mrs. is a coffee nut so we drive all over in search of the best cup and the best beans. It is one of our two very favorite places.

First of all, their coffee beans...  We are firm believers in getting beans that are locally roasted. We've subscribed to the belief that flavor is lost  as you get too far out from the roasting. Cartel roasts their own and does a ridiculous job. They do a great decaf and a number of interesting and excellent regular varietals. If you don't already buy locally roasted beans, do yourself a favor and give Cartel's a shot.

As far as their in-house coffee drinks, the Cartel folk are pretty much obsessive in their pursuit of excellence. You won't find the million varieties of crazy drinks they now do in many coffeehouses but  you will find excellent drinks done by people who are serious about what they are doing. I for one, am happy to roll with their recommendations when I am there and enjoy my whole milk, leaded latte with agave syrup. 

They also have a Clover machine (which many say does the best brewed coffee) which does 1 cup at a time. You will also see the beans individually packaged for the clover right nearby. One of the philosophies the folks there have expressed is that you want to get the beans brewing as soon after grind as possible. They've even minimized the number of steps you have to take to do this.

Cartel Coffee Lab is also a very, very cool place. It's kind of tucked away in a strip mall off University back behind Eastside Records. They've taken this industrial space and kept some of that which adds to the charm and also have put very cool local art throughout. Some of it changes which is also nice. They've also fabricated some things like the bar and space dividers which give it a neat look. Their roaster also sits out in full view. In addition to all this, they always have great music playing. Something about sitting down on one of those couches with their background music instantly relaxes me.

And the last bonus for me is that with them being so obsessive about coffee, they also sell some great equipment in the front. We bought our burr grinder from them and couldn't be happier.

About the only thing about Cartel that is disappointing to us is that they have recently stopped pulling decaf espresso shots. From what I understand, this happened because they switched their grinder system out for a better one. I hope at some point, they decide to grab one of their own burr grinders for sale and reverse this change.

But I really don't like the way the quality of service has dipped down here ever since the owners aren't around that much anymore. 

Being ignored while figuring out the tip jar, having judgments made about wanting soy creamer in my coffee, being ignored while baristas are between shifts while there are FOUR baristas sitting at the counter watching a line of 10 people form, light bulbs not getting replaced in lamps for months, having other customers made fun of once they are out of earshot, etc. 

Oh, and my partner doesn't drink coffee or tea. They asked him what he drank, and he said once in a while he likes Italian soda and was told ""Oh you like the high fructose syrup huh?"" Excuse me? We just bought 3 drinks from you, tipped you, and you have the audacity to make judgments about someone you have no clue about (that man reads more ingredient labels than the Whole Foods CEO)?!? 

I feel terrible having to write this, but several of my friends have noted the service here has been rude, dismissive (I would be exaggerating if I stated that was every experience-I have had nice exchanges, but when I start to dread going into a place b/c of an attitude, that is bad). I even had a barista tell me I should thank the other barista for getting my soy latte right-um, yes I appreciate the effort...that is why I paid you 4 bucks, not including tip. 

Regarding slow service, I have been told there will now be bar backs to help out with orders to help pare down the line, which is a great idea.

They stopped doing decaf coffee drinks, leaving me with either the jitters for 2 days if I really want a latte or having to get the Decaf clover (which is delish but not really that special from my own french press), so that is a major bummer for people with high sensitivity to caffeine such as myself.

BUT- I will say their superior product, the care the baristas put into their product, their location are all factors that still get some stars from me and I am willing to come in here again in the future, I just really need a break from tipping a staff that is so uneven.

The first time we went, we had 2 cappuccinos (for here--they won't make them to go, understandably, as it ruins the foam). One of the owners made them for us, then told us the next time we came they were on him as they were rather wet. Certainly weren't the best-prepared cappuccinos, but at least he knows what a cappuccino is supposed to be. And any way, the coffee itself made up for the poor foam--just delicious. I wouldn't say that I'm a coffee expert by any means, but the flavor of the coffee just really stood out above any other I have had in a long time. That's probably because the owners get the beans from fair-trade farms in Guatemala (which they have visited), and then roast them themselves in the ware-housey shop. We later bought 2 bags of coffee to give as gifts, a dark Guatemala roast and the Black Market Espresso (tasted the first, which was good at home but not as good as when made at the Lab). You can also purchase cool coffee equipment in the front. The only downside would be a small amount of food available.

I have to assume it's called a ""Coffee Lab"" for a reason.  Too many coffee shops these days are retail stores, where coffee is an incidental thing in all the yelling, stupid names, and fancy colors.  If you look at the menu of Cartel Coffee Lab, there are a total of 13 items.  It's all about the coffee, plain and simple.

Then again, there's really nothing simple about it to those who take their coffee as seriously as this place does.  The artistry of their baristas is not to be trifled with.  These people can make a latte so pretty, you really won't want to drink it (until you do, then you're happy you did).  On top of that, the selection of coffee varietals is impressive.  I've only tried one, but that alone was better than anything Starbucks tries to pawn off on the masses.  Perhaps the use of the term ""Lab"" is because they've actually stepped beyond anything any other coffee shop has done.  Either way, the formula that they came up with works better than anything I've come across before.

Then again, maybe I'm being too hard on the other places.  It's not that they have an intrinsically inferior product, but the reason for these places has been lost behind t shirts and mugs and open mic nights and selling you a card containing the same money you'd use on the place anyway...

I digress.  Cartel Coffee Labs is a great place with a fantastic product.  If their WiFi is weak or the back corner gets dark, I honestly don't care.  Their coffee is excellent and I'll be coming back for more.",lczLjHO7zIhrmSlOXI3ohg

Cons - The service is hit-or-miss. Some of the people that work there are awesome and friendly. Some are kind of snooty and rude. They have a small staff and are pretty busy so it's usually about a ten minute wait from entrance to exit if you're getting coffee to go. The line takes a few minutes and the drink takes a few minutes. This place is hipster central which isn't a big deal, I just thought it was worth noting. 

Pros - The coffee really is good. The people that make the drinks are skilled and everything comes out delicious. The atmosphere is artsy, funky and fun. 

Prices are okay. About the same as Starbucks and more expensive than Xtreme Bean, but a better product fosho.

I think Cartel has cultivated a loyal following of people that come for the coffee. Convenience is probably also a factor because of the sweet location.

First, Cartel makes what is, in my opinion, the best cappuccino in Arizona.  It's simply perfect and they serve it in the traditional size and fashion.  If you are a member of the weight-loss crowd, this one is not for you since they don't offer sugar-free syrups or skim milk.  But believe me, this one is worth the calories.

Next, you will likely have to contend with the crowd.  During the school year, Cartel stays pretty full of hipsters toting their macbooks and self-aware ironic t-shirts.

I've never had this happen at any of the really good coffee places around town.  

I ended up settling for an iced tea and my friend and I sat down and talked for a bit.  We ended up chatting with one of the other patrons for a while, but eventually ended up cutting our stay short because the place was so incredibly loud and there were some kids running around the place that were getting on our nerves.  I think the acoustics aren't very good in there and it seems like everyone's conversation gets amplified and thrown right in your face.  Rather than yell, we just gave up and moved on.  

I have a feeling that Cartel will eventually end up being a great place, but based on my experience they need to work on their consistency.  The employees have seemed nice both times I've been there, but pouring a sour shot is unacceptable and so is running out of beans.  If they work on training their barristas and get their logistics together I am sure Cartel will eventually be a great place.  A little work on the acoustics of the place couldn't hurt, either.

It is a pretty small spot, very cozily tucked inside of the complex across from Wet Paint. If you are having trouble finding it, take note that they have a dangling, long wooden sign that says Cartel outside of their door.
I went in with a mate and we each had a cuppa. She took an iced toddy and I had an iced mocha.
Their beans are quite sapid; a bit piquant, while still being very smooth in flavour. Of course, we both sampled the other's drink, which helped give a slightly well-rounded review as opposed to just having one. I would go back for either or. If you like your drink to taste like coffee and not like some kind of milky smoothie, make sure to ask for an extra shot in your mocha. I don't mind either way.

I don't usually drink milk, but the only alternative milk they appeared to have was soy, and that adds a pretty strong flavour and consistency to an iced drink especially, so I avoided it.

As far as the place itself, it is much bigger than I expected, walking in to it. It has a pretty hip vibe, featuring a space-separator made completely of bicycle tires. There is a book for drawing in on the central-most coffee table that is full of, can you believe it, mostly not drawings, but bad notes. It would have been neater if it was genuinely full of drawings that seemed inspired, but you can't blame that on the staff, really.

It was bustling, full of a wide range of people, and it has a lot of mediocre-to-okay-to-occasionally-something art everywhere that may be off-putting if you have a really critical eye or may be attractive if you like the whimsy.

The parking lot was also completely full, so I parked across the street at the gas station. Don't park in front of the dry cleaner/laundromat- they tow.

Some people will complain that they can't get their favorite mint mocha caramel skinny soy latte here, or that they won't let them ruin a cappuccino by sucking it through a hole in a to-go cup, but this is not the coffee shop for that kind of person.  Cartel is not Burger King. It's not ""your way right away"", it's ""their way or the highway."" They know their way. If you appreciate super high quality espresso and properly steamed milk in a real cappuccino, this is the ONLY place for you. No place else in Phoenix comes even close. Places like Lux and Goldbar are nice enough, but not even on the same planet as Cartel when it comes to the quality of the coffee.

Others complain about the slow service. It is slow, but it's slow for a reason. The barista makes each order start to finish with no shortcuts before starting on the next order. No pre-ground coffee, ever. No letting espresso sit around, even for a few seconds. No re-using old, already steamed milk. Regular coffee is made one cup at a time using just-ground beans and a Hario filter and cone, with water temperature controlled to precisely 206F. It takes a while, but you get something that's the best the barista can deliver. A big difference from the mediocre crap served at the typical coffee shop. 

I think this is my favorite part of Cartel. They do not pander to the lowest common denominator. They do the best they can, all the time, even if some of their customers don't get it.  

The only possible complaint I have is that most of their roasted coffee is South American, and they seem to like to bring out the fruity notes that those coffees have when they roast. There can be a little bit of sameness there, at least for me. I would prefer more variety in the regions the coffee beans come from, and a larger variety in flavor profiles.",GE-34FoRSTKuw8OWBc4YrA

Specifically I obsess over their brewed coffee which is made by an advanced coffee brewer (Clover) with a roast that you pick to be brewed. Obviously this is the only method for producing a supremely great cup of coffee (ie: freshly ground beans [roasted recently on-site] placed immediately into an instant coffee maker that produces one cup at a time). I have never had coffee made for me in such a caring way anywhere else. Even in other (read: better) cities I have never visited a cafe that roasts, grinds and produces the coffee in front of me. It's top notch.

If you don't want a brewed coffee (you should try it, come on!) then there are some good alternatives. The Excelente Latte is a wonderfully ingenious creation that is expressively Phoenician (or I guess more appropriately Tempeian). It's more or less a latte with horchata added. Served only over ice, it's great in the summer time.

Their coffee beans are all organically grown, and I assume the owner must work very hard to source the beans personally because everyone that touches them is very knowledgeable about where they came from, when they were roasted etc. That alone is impressive.

Cartel as a cafe is fairly unique... Cartel's atmosphere is just okay.. I wouldn't want to spend more time here than I had to. I just can't spend that much time in a decaying strip mall which happens to be the hub of Tempe's hipster scene... it's not that I don't love hipsters, but hordes of them get old.. I tend to prefer a more diverse set of patrons.

The quality coffee that Cartel offers more than makes up for anything I could fault them for.

So, in summery, I recommend the brewed coffees. Once you've tried their brew then I suppose you could go for a different drink next time, which I promise will also be wonderful.",CbtlzjG8Vfvh5cal6N82Nw

Ever since http://www.yelp.com/biz/portola-coffee-lab-costa-mesa

The boyfriend and I wanted to see if there's more of these kind of coffee lab. Yay! Found one in Arizona! Glad we found one near where he lives, because I didn't want to drive any further than 20 mins plus to get some good coffee. 

Came here in the afternoon on a Saturday, and man were there a lot of people just studying. 

Drinks
+Iced Toddy ($3.95) - The boyfriend got this and holy cow was it strong. A very concentrated coffee. It's like drinking a americano at Starbucks but without mixing it with water. But of course this place was a bit better because it's different 

+ Iced Chai with Soy milk ($4.85) - Yums! You can adjust the sweetness of it, but I forgot to do so so it was a bit too sweet for me.

So when you are looking for this place, don't expect a huge sign...it's actually just a door with a 6 X 11 sign that says ""cartel coffee lab""...I was afraid that there would be a secret knock to get in. Once you enter, you'll be overly stimulated by nude art and creative pieces of functional décor. Plenty of seating and outlets make for a student friendly environment. The music selection is rather schizophrenic. It's like a Pantera/Metallica mix meets Garden State soundtrack. Seriously, it would wax wane between nice and chill to yelling...i.e. The Only Living Boy in New York by Simon and Garfunkel  followed by Lightsabre Co**sucking Blues by Mclusky....that's right I had to shazam it because I was so turned off by the music selection....just pick one or the other.

Their menu has no prices on it and that annoys me. I asked where the prices were and they said they weren't printed anywhere....couldn't even find them online. Just not customer friendly I thought.

I always get a double espresso wherever I go, so I decided to order that here. According to the barista it had an accent of lime with an almond hint and gave me a tadbit of the ugh. It was sour and didn't go down smoothly at all. The lime overwhelmed what I think the barista was intending. Maybe I just couldn't appreciate the complexity of the brew - but it wasn't for me. The espresso came with a shot of club soda as well to keep the palate cleansed and I wish I had more club soda to wash away the taste. I will say beware, the strength of 1 shot of espresso is tantamount to 2 shots at other places...needless to say my double shot will keep me awake until dawn.

They appear to make every single cup to order, using those mug-topping cone filter holder thingies. Clearly I do not know the technical term as I have never been a barista/coffee technician/PhD, but I do know when a cup of coffee tastes amazing. And this was decaf, no less.

Make sure you know exactly where you're going before you attempt to find this place, though. It's tricky to find, and Google Maps in its fuzzy wisdom does not help a whole lot as often happens. I'd call ahead just to be sure so you don't end up driving up and down the street like I did wondering where the hell this place is and why my Droid says it's 250 feet away but I don't see a coffee shop ANYWHERE. Turns out it really was within 250 feet, but it's got a tiny sign hanging over a tiny, nondescript door. Kind of odd, like they want to keep it a secret, almost. Doesn't seem to affect business, though, and that's a testament to how great their coffee is.

Very cool interior design too, low-budget materials handled creatively for a unique, industrial-fabulous feeling. And clean - too often an attempt at industrial-fabulous results in filthy, nasty spaces where you feel like you have to wash your hands after you leave, but in keeping with the quality of the coffee, the space is wonderfully clean. At a certain age, like the day after graduating from college, nasty dirty places lose their ""ooh-it's-so-edgy"" vibe, you know?

Only drawback is, the food selections are limited, so don't go there thinking you're going to have a hearty breakfast like I did. In the end, the coffee was just so good that I didn't care that I had to make do with a muffin. And no, like other reviewers, I don't go for the hipster scene, but eh whatever, again at a certain age you realize the hipsters are sheep like the rest of us so who cares, let them half-sneer (because a full sneer takes too much energy and enthusiasm) at my terrible fashion sense, I'm too busy enjoying the incredible coffee to care.",aidmFfjOjpVKD-5L4J6X7w

I've watched the company grow since the beginning and at least in the Tempe location, it has stayed both an iconic experience of Tempe life near ASU, and a provider of both exceptional coffee and tea drinks and baked goods. I generally go in for a large, hot, Cafe Americano with room for cream ($3.75 - told you, not cheap) and today I had something new, a toasted English muffin with jam (the person taking the order referred to as a jammy dodger, maybe a UK expression) and it takes a few minutes to toast but it comes out blazing hot with a little bag with a napkin, plastic knife and a little container of butter and one of jam, at least this time it was apricot and it was delicious, I have a feeling it is locally made (assumption on my part). The texture of the English Muffin was wonderful, weighty texture and crusty and I'm assuming it is also locally made. From my final bill it is $3 and of course, I tipped a dollar on the overall cost so $7.75 for the cost of the cafe americano and the baked good.

Oh, and of course, wonderful new locally made art up on the walls again today and some wonderful new music on the sound system.....I don't give a lot of five stars out but honestly, this is coffee counterculture (little play on words, counterculture being variance on the norm and coffee places having a counter on....okay, not that funny but at least I tried). They do have wi-fi and if you buy something you get the password for the day. I generally go when they first open but they are open, I believe, from 7 am till 11 pm at night.

There aren't too many places in the entire country that pay this much attention to detail in every aspect of their product.  Their selection is narrow but very discerning, mostly Central and South American (true to the Cartel name), and roasted fresh on location several times a week (never overdone).  Just ask the employees when the roasting takes place and you can come get a front row seat.  

Besides roasting the coffee fresh, they are the only place that I know of that insist on using a pour-over brewing technique with high-end Hario equipment, which gives the barista maximum control over the brew.  

Its also rare to find coffee shop employees that are both friendly, and know what the hell they're talking about without talking to you in a condescending manner.  That's a breath of fresh air.

While the atmosphere may not be ""your speed"", the product alone deserves 5 stars.   No need to go somewhere else and pay for sweetened charcoal water.

Looks like there planning a micro-brewery in the adjacent room.  Can't wait for that.

-Wide range of roasts that appeal to almost any coffee preference (save for you weirdo super dark drinkers)
-Espresso Excelente = Horchata with shots.  Literally.
-Handmade furniture and fixtures care of owner Jason littered throughout.
-All prices figured to 5 or 0 (aka no pennies necessary)
-Staff legitimately cares about all aspects of coffee and some aspects of tea

Especially Notable:
-If you were to have taken Cartel's regular clientele and plopped them down into another very good coffee shop like Lux, they would all have sat separately and talked sparingly even though the seating at Lux might be even more inviting and communal in nature.  For some reason people open up here.  It is not out of the ordinary for two complete strangers to spark up a spontaneous conversation and actually enjoy each other's opinion on topics outside of the normal social boundary of small talk.  I have been to most of the other coffee shops in the greater Phoenix area, and while some do have excellent drinks and baristas, none have fostered such an air of openness and loving friendship. 

I never truly enjoyed coffee until I had a cup here (Sweet Yellow, although Blue is great, too).  The existence of this place gives me renewed hope for a resurgence of sincerity and artistry in a town taken over by fearless big boxes and scaredy-cat hipsters and wannabes.

The staff is always super friendly and their drinks are great.  I've never like coffee.  Ever.  I've tried it a couple times throughout my life and it's just never done it for me, so I've always been a tea girl.  THEN, my husband and I went to Cartel one day and while he was tending to our toddler, I went to put some cream in his iced coffee.  I had a little bit of an overflow dilemma, and there were no towels or any potential clean up devices in sight.  So I was forced to take a sip to prevent the spill... and I was shocked and pleasantly surprised that I actually LIKED the coffee!  It wasn't bitter or nasty at all.  Very smooth and delicious, and creamy because of, well, the cream.  My poor husband only got to drink about half his coffee that day, and then deal with me being wired for the next few hours.

The usual tea I get there is always great, too.  I've only tried one so far, the black mango pineapple (or something along those lines) and it's delish!  Mildly sweet and fruity, extremely yummy.  

I like the way the interior is designed, with bike tires and interesting photos on the walls.  My toddler loves to look around and inquire about what everything is.  There's never been a long wait and we've been there at different times on weekend mornings.  Early-ish, and later towards the afternoon.  Never overly crowded, never empty.

Man, this is a great place to come sit, sip, and vibe.  Tonight I went with the Americano with a Mocha to go for the wife.  Both are stellar drinks and I picked up a bag of the Black Market Espresso to try at home.

As for the sitting, there are a few tables in the front for you to get some one on one time, 2 couches which are fairly comfy and then a lot of cafeteria like arrangements, so if you are a little shy, then grab a cup to go.  I would recommend coming in and feeding off the vibe.  They usually have some form of good music whether it is the speakers or a live DJ.  It is a very industrial feel inside, but the energy is amazing.  

It is also one of the best cups of joe I have experienced in the valley (whether drinking in or taking out).  The coffee has bold rich flavors and it is roasted right there onsite.  If you are in during roasting hours, then that just adds to the overall experience.

Food; Coffee & Tea,lktu5JPDlQUG-7cV7gOzDQ,Cartel Coffee Lab,264,4.5,4,5,"I have to say that I was pretty intimidated to try Cartel about a year and a half ago - simply based on poor service reviews and threats of hipster judgment.

When I want coffee, its because I'm beastly. I just woke up, I'm not looking like the hottest/hippest/nicest person in Tempe. I mean, I never look like that but when I NEED coffee, I need to dose myself in a safe and secure environment.

So I went to Cartel expecting the worst, I ordered Iced Toddy. To keep my order neutral and cheap. It was okay. Pretty f-ing good in comparison to xtreme bean, my only other Toddy experience. I branched out into soy Lattes because I like to get some protein in the morning. I know....latte for breakfast - aren't I a pillar of health?

NO ONE judged me when I would order my soy latte with sugar-free vanilla in it. NO ONE. I've gotten some jokes about it, but who gives a fuck? It's $4.50 - I'm being a yuppie suburban bore when I order it and I know it and I don't give a shit if they know it. I love them for keeping me in check anyways. How is a kid from Tempe supposed to know anything about coffee? That's not my business. As the customer, it's our business to try new things as suggested by the people who's life's work is coffee.

So I tried an americano by suggestion. Its DELICIOUS. GET ONE. Iced/Hot, whatthefuckeverjustgetone. I go here for an americano EVERY SINGLE DAY OF MY LIFE except when I am out of town and I bemoan the lack of Cartel even when I'm in Los Angeles (Mighty City of Intelligentsia). Which brings me to another point, the LINES.

If you are looking for a McLatte, they exist. It's called McDonalds. They are everywhere. Cartel is not a run in/run out kind of place. They are offering a luxury item as well as an experience. You wouldn't go to a spa and bitch about your facial taking too long. If you want to see lines, go to Intelligentsia during the midday rush and you will immediately appreciate what Cartel is doing.

For serving the entire ASU community with outstanding coffee, 20 minutes sounds about right. For a drink that is delicately crafted from bean to cup, $2.50-$4.50 is just right. For a locally owned company successfully competing with corporate giants, you might as well just go and give a deserving shop your money. 

And if you are nervous about being judged by the ""hip"" kids who look like they smelled a fart, recognize that they are only posing with their macbooks and modern literature and are too vain to break character. 
And if you are nervous about being judged by the baristas, try SMILING at the people who are SERVING you - because you remember how hard it was to deal with customers before you got your middle management salaried job, right?

I love you, Cartel.",_HvJzf1-4g5isNFaOEAIrQ

Very quaint and unpretentious both inside and out, with eclectic decor and classic music playing (we heard several Beatles tunes while dining)

The staff are very nice - we were welcomed right away by a gentleman who seemed to be the owner or at least manager. He made sure to point out the breakfast items on the boards and made some recommendations when he noticed that it was our first time there. 

There is a counter right by the kitchen as well as a bar top within the dining room. Additionally, there are several 2-top tables set along a banquette on one wall. We did not sit out on the patio but it seemed cute - it is tucked behind the restaurant, the seating is not in front as is pictured in some of the Yelp pictures. 

We ordered the breakfast burrito, banana nutella crepes, and the simple breakfast (I can't remember what it was technically called - eggs, bacon, toast) The breakfast burrito was a good size and came with a little dish of salsa - I felt it definitely needed the salsa to complete the flavors of the dish (the burrito was a little bland but the ingredients were all good) The banana nutella crepes were yummy (it is hard to complain about nutella for breakfast) and the eggs/bacon/toast dish did it's job. The coffee was delicious. The only downer food-wise was the blueberry scone: it was a bit dry and not super flavorful. 
 
Pricing is pretty high ($36+tip for 3 of us), especially for a place where you need to help yourself to silverware (set up on a station to the side of the entryway) and that doesn't provide some small niceties like butter (for the scone) automatically. 

Lastly, we brought our 1-year old son, as we are wont to do for weekend brunch, and after ordering we discovered to our dismay that they do not have highchairs at the restaurant. We had not brought a stroller, because it is usually so bulky that it inconveniences other patrons, so we did not have a great solution for corralling a very busy toddler. We managed though, creating a space for him in the corner of the banquette, but it definitely made for a less relaxing brunch than we would have liked, especially at that price point. Now, perhaps it is one of those places that proudly does NOT encourage children (in fact there is actually a sign on the back porch that says ""unattended children will be given espresso and a kitten"", which is good natured but still pointed :) ) 

Anyhow, it was a nice spot, very picturesque with yummy food and coffee, and we will likely go back - perhaps with out of town guests  and when we can leave our peanut with sitters so that we won't have to stress about seating for him.",yiHkeSEzTZWLnWUsgSUvDA

My toddy and americanos have been good every time. I would go as far to say they serve Lux coffee better then Lux does. However The pastries have been hit or miss.

I would think after a year the kinks of running a shop would be worked out and you would retain your team but not the case here.

Even though I knew that I'd be full from the sandwich, I couldn't resist snagging a brown butter scone when I saw it was the last one. Definitely made the right decision on that one, I'm a sucker for brown butter anything and the scone didn't disappoint. My friend ordered the Iced Toddy which was really good-- spiced but mellow. I ordered a latte and didn't like it quite as much. The owner was super friendly and remembered my name for the 1.5+ hrs. my friend and I lingered in the shop. He even gave me a (delicious) orange-zest filled strawberry muffin on the way out! If I didn't live so far away, I would be here all the time. As it is, I'll definitely be back soon.",Rr_-gavCIZXETevIFD29cA

I got the bacon and egg croissant sandwich. The croissant was perfectly flakey and buttery, the eggs over easy were full of flavor and the bacon was cooked exactly the way bacon should be, not overly or under. Carmel's uses  the high quality bacon if you're a bacon snob like me. The sandwich is surprisingly large and is enough to fill a hungry man.The picky eater I was with had the crepes and she was beyond satisfied, I stole a bite and it was delicious. I took two blueberry scones home for my roommates because they looked so fresh- They were gone in about 30 seconds of arriving home and said they were the best pastries they've had. I'm giving this place 5 stars because the food was above any expectations I could have hoped for and the interior was very comfortable and warm. (Love the bar setup if you're alone). The owner Pat was helpful and friendly. The person beside us ordered the traditional breakfast with sunny side up eggs and it looked great. Everyone seemed very content with their meals.

Make sure to go out back and enjoy your latte or crepes. They made the best out of that little area.

Outside it looks like a little cottage (with cat claw climbing up one side of it! tres magnifique!) with quaint french white and blue furniture for a coffee on the patio. There actually was a table of Frenchmen doing such on my second visit! 

Inside the tables have bright flowers in little vases. (see attached photo) Annnnnd there was a chalk elephant and monkey on the floor! Art house oils on the walls enhance the aesthetics. It just has this simple and wonderful charm. 

There were whole fresh strawberries embedded in my muffin. So goooood. It had those flaky crumbles on the top too. In front of the pastries are little placards. They have descriptives like ""elegant"" or ""scrumptious"". The owner smiled and said his girlfriend is in PR and she's responsible for that. I thought it was beyond endearing. 

The owner, in fact, is really amiable. He asked my friend and me if we'd like to see the patio. It's not ready yet for sitting... But! He plans to paint it ""terracotta like"", plant some bougainvillea, buy some hotel valley ho inspired umbrellas, plus misters for the summertime. I absolutely cannot wait.

Weird to say that but it was and I LOVE QUICHE!  But the consistency was undesirable.  It was like flan and turned into mush in my mouth.  It also only had a few veggies on the top layer but not throughout.  I think (and this is only speculation) but it may have had some cream of mushroom or something as the base.  It was just not very good.  I ate about an 1/8 and threw it out.  I felt terrible about wasting the food and money.  My boyfriend had the croissant sandwich with bacon and eggs.  Again, it was a let down.  It was super boring and it could have easily been made in my own kitchen.  As for the coffee, since this is a coffee house, was also not what I would have expected.  The iced coffee was super watery.  It had a decent taste but it lacked boldness.  We also tried the lattes the day before and they were nothing to get uber excited about.

To sum up this review, yes it was, but let me explain a little bit more in depth. 

The little cottage surrounded by welcoming tables and chairs in its front yard practically smiled at me as I walked up. It was around 4:25 PM as I walked through the doors. As I entered, the barista looked up and said they were closing. Tear. She must have noticed my look of disappointment, because she asked me what I was planning on ordering. When I mentioned that I was planning on getting an iced coffee, she pleasantly said that she could assist and welcomed me inside. Phew! So with that, the customer service earned this shop a point right off the bat. 

The coffee shop is intimate and quaint. It has the memory of the former tenants yet they've rearranged the interior to give it their own coffee shop twist. To the right, I noticed several small booths perfect for an afternoon of working. I was impressed at how many tables they fit inside, considering the size of the cottage. I wouldn't suggest that you meet here with your study group of ten, but if it's just you or maybe one or two others, it's a nice little spot! 

Baked goods such as muffins, pie and scones lined the counter. I was tempted, but I knew dinner was just around the corner so I fought temptation. Next time though! I ordered the medium iced toddy. Normally I drink iced coffee with non-fat milk and a hint of sugar free syrup. This toddy would have worked without either, but I couldn't avoid adding at least a little non-fat milk to it. The coffee was good and had the caffeine kick I needed to get me through the day. I also like the fact that they use Cartel products. 

I like Carmel's because it has the Downtown Phoenix coffee shop vibe for the Arcadia crew. It isn't stuffy in there, it doesn't feel like your typical corporate coffee shops that surround Arcadia and Scottsdale and it has a nice independent feeling that fills this cottage with character. Once I walked inside, I would have never guessed a Jack-in-the-Box was just next door. 

I think this is a perfect location for this coffee shop and it'll be nice to stop in and grab a drink and baked item...and probably stay and work for a little bit too!

Why 4 stars, not 5?  It's just not that awesome an experience to come here, but I don't know what I'm looking for in a coffee house for 5 stars.  Nothing personal for Bunna.  I'm glad they're here.

The door was opened for me upon approaching it, and I was warmly greeted by a man who I assumed to be the owner.  That was awesome.

Getting inside, there are children crawling around on the ground and on furniture, literally screaming... and it smells.

I walked up to the counter and a girl said ""hi,"" I said, ""hi,"" and I looked  up at the menu to see what I wanted... I kept looking and kept thinking and she remained silent and just stared at me.... this is not the kind of service I expect at a coffee shop... maybe some suggestions, or questions... ""so is this your first time here?"" would have been nice.  Just silence.

I ended up just ordering a toddy, and it was okay.  I prefer the ones from Cartel most definitely though. 

I went to throw my straw wrapper away and the counter with forks and condiments and sugar and whatnot was visibly sticky and gross.  There was a bin with a sign over it reading ""dirty dishes,"" that was indeed FILLED with dirty, smelly dishes.

-You're gunna wanna chat with the nice folks at Bunna.
-Their coffee is very good and shade grown but you can drink it in the sunna.
-Here at Bunna they really know their stuff and you can get toddy at Bunna.
-It takes real coffee expertise at a coffee house to even know what toddy is - go to Bunna and try it.
-Gabi's office hours at Bunna brought me here in a roundabout way.
-Meet with a friend is what I was gunna, he said hey let's meet over at this place I tried with Gabi, do you know it, it's called Bunna.

*Toddy - coffee brewed by soaking the grounds in cold water for 12 hours or so, then draining off the liquid.  The result is highly caffeinated, very smooth, concentrated coffee which can then be used in drinks in place of espresso or consumed on it's own.  It is very smooth because no hot water or steam is used as in regular brewing methods and the bitter acids that are released from the beans by heat are not present in the toddy.",P2kVk4cIWyK4e4h14RhK-Q

The Dennys...was no longer in effect. A strip mall sign caught the eye-Croissants? This could be worthy.

We pulled up and walked past a place that promised Fair Trade Coffee, charming cafe tables with a sullen 12 year old kid with his iPod reading the New Times...and walked over the croissant place-the pastries looked delish but the atmosphere was...eh...unappealing? So we went actually inside Bunna to a really nice cozy space! Walls painted blue, plum and apple green; various small couches, some high tables (guess who didn't sit there!), and some low large round tables. One table had like ten senior citizens laughing it up, there were intense types on their lap-tops, and a massive sign showcasing all their coffee drinks. However, they only had cold breakfast stuff, so we asked if we could bring over sandwiches from Pleaissant Croissants-and she first said ""Um, no you can't!.....Ah ha! Of course you can!"" I went from sheer panic to elation-this place has FLAVA.

I ordered just plain coffee (with a bizarre aside, was served in a blue ceramic IKEA coffee mug that just happens to be MY favourite mug I use for coffee at my house...in fact I am drinking out of it RIGHT NOW) while my companion had a mango naked juice. This time around I got to browse around-def. has hippie vibes-there was Ten Thousand Villages merchandise there, hippie soap, incense, teas and coffee beans for sale and some hemp bags. Their pastries did look yummy and they had what I call ""bird seed treats"" for all the granola heads. In the cooler they had all the naked juices, Virgils root beer, Hansens soda, I mean so many drink options I kinda had to block it off. Also some delectable sprouts and fruit salads in the cooler as well.

Their customer service may even be better than the intoxicating aromas. I can always count on a caffeinated barista's, ""hello, you take two shots, right?"" to snap me out of an aroma coma. I've only recently discovered Bunna and they already know that I like two shots of espresso in an extra dry cappuccino.  

You can tell that their baristas enjoy what they do and like being there. They are well trained, friendly, and can consistently make a good extra dry cappuccino. I can taste the slightly sweet and feel the velvety texture of the foam that floats on top a very clean tasting espresso as I type.

Why then the 4 stars? They do a great job supporting local businesses and the organic lifestyle but their menu lacks in creativity using seasonal produce. 

But mostly, and if they did I don't know what would happen to my budget, I wish they sold fresh baked goods. That would be heavenly for me and 5 stars for them if they sold perfectly flaky and warm buttery croissants to go along with their perfectly prepared cappuccinos.

It's super caffeinated though--I drove back to LA high and wired!  I got the spiced version, which has subtle flavors of clove, cinnamon, and cardammon(?)

The owner was so nice and even explained to me how a Toddy is made.  They even have supplies in the store if you want to try and make your own at home.  Everything in the store is FAIR TRADE and ORGANIC.  You can also purchase loose leaf teas and coffee beans by the pound.  I got 2oz (about 10-12 servings) of Blueberry Rooibos tea for $5!

Definitely check this place out--I read a sign on the door that said they are trying to change ownership, so hopefully this place will not go by the wayside.

Boba Tea House has near-perfect pearls. Not too soft (you can still use them as missiles should you choose as they do not stick to the straw), not too hard (your jaw won't ache).

Seriously, we have boba in socal on every corner, some better than others, but people here are deprived!

Until one day my roommate took a trip down to chandler and brought me back awesomeness in a cup. Since then I have made several trips of my own with the excuse of visiting friends to come to this place lol. Yes they use powder but they use a blender to mix it with the tea and milk so its a little thicker in consistency, just short of creamy, mmmmm. Quality is noticeably better!

My favorites are the honey green milk tea and coconut milk tea. Have also tried the black milk tea, boba milk tea, peach black tea, taro milk tea, and almond milk tea and they were all good.

The thai tea was from a mix that had non-dairy creamer instead of milk but it was tasty and the boba cooked to perfection.

For the uninitiated,  Boba Tea is various types of teas, slushes or milk drinks that you can have them put these little tapioca balls into.  They are about the size of a pea and they taste kinda sweet and are chewy.  They serve two purposes as far as I can tell.  To shoot up your straw at light speed and cause you to foolishly choke in front of your hot lady date or to turn the boring ho-hum activity of drinking into a fun filled game of hide and go seek with your straw.  
Now I usually get one of two drinks, the Black Honey Tea with boba or the Ginger Milk drink with boba as well.  Both are awesome in their own respect.  The Black tea is very light and thirst quenching and the Ginger Milk is creamy, sweet with the throat burning effects only ginger can give.

I am instantly transported back to the days of youth soccer wherein I was the only kid too stupid to jam that straw through the top of a caprisun.

Make note that there is a $5 minimum if you plan to use your debit card and that a regular size (there are two sizes) boba is not $5+.",hW2XQMGHy5_TW7dnijZR6Q

Otherwise, I'd be that fan that stops by every single day. Well, until I get a boba place near me in the North Phoenix/Scottsdale (hint hint) then I just have to settle for visiting Boba Tea House once a month or so when I hit up LeeLee's for a grocery stock up trip. Oh, and you best believe that I stock up on my boba too. Yes, that's me carrying a tray of 4 milk teas so I have one for the ride home and a couple for later. What can I say, I really like milk teas.

At Boba Tea House, in particular, I'm a fan of their lavender milk tea - it is deelish! I also get the coconut milk tea or lychee milk tea if the mood strikes me. The hubby sticks with his favorite thai milk tea which is strong...just the way he likes it.

Like most boba places, you can get regular boba, mini boba or an assortment of jellies. I typically forgo the boba entirely and stick with coconut or lychee jellies. They add a burst of sweetness and have a texture that I prefer over boba. 

Already looking forward to my next venture out to this area so I can treat myself to more milk teas and I'll just continue waiting for one to pop up in this area...",hcctCQy3bdZMezrUKkZLtA

They offer a wide variety of flavors and most can be mixed.  I don't venture into paths unknown with my drinks and always grab a lychee snow with boba.  

I've been impressed with each visit.  The only draw back is that I don't feel comfortable hanging out there.  If you're over 18 you will most likely be the oldest person in the joint.  Typically I drop by for a boba after shopping at the market next door and bail when my drink is ready.  I imagine it makes a good hangout place for a younger crowd.

One time, I blamed it on the late hour but I don't go late very often.  I started asking for 'light ice' in my tea because you never know if it's going to be weak or not but, after this last trip, I think I'll just find another place to get my boba fix.

I tossed my grocery bags in the car,  Grabbed my $4 and hiked across the parking lot to Boba Tea House.

Last time I drove by Boba Tea House, the place was packed.  Not true of this visit.  It was so empty the place echoed.  It's a cute place.  I like the couches, and they have a couple of lappies on a table at the side for people to use.  I am going to assume it is free because while I was there, a guy popped in, used a laptop, and left.  Either he's a regular and has an account, or it was free because i didn't see him pull out a card to credit to use it.

The Orange and Green wall menu has all the milk teas, slushes, snows and other beverages divided into categories.  Most are named for exactly what they are.  A couple are named for appearance.... like sunset, but not enough to confuse anyone.  There is also a section for snacks that has tasty tidbits that are perfectly sized for sharing.  I noticed coconut shrimp, and a few other little fried things.

I decided to have a coconut slush.  It was good, but it was not as good as I thought it would be.  It was a little bitter, and a was not blended as well as I have had in other places.  The snack I chose for lunch was the really delightful surprise.  I came for the boba, but now I am hooked on their calamari.  I have NEVER had fresher or more tender calamari.  It was absolutely perfect.  I'm always cautious about it too because most places overcook it til it is about the same texture as a bicycle inner tube.... this was delicious.  I had it medium spicy, which was MY mistake.  

Next time I will order my calamari spiced mild.  It's a good thing I got coconut boba to cool my taste buds after each bite.",AnH84g9V10x41CXmCvcaFg

My favorite flavor is almond milk tea, and I use the natural tea taste with the mixture of almond flavor to see quality of the boba drink.  You can taste the natural tea flavor and the sweetness of the almond is not overpowering the tea taste.  I like that they have other add-ons such as Lychee.

Huge, fluffy eggs. Buttery croissants. Thick cut tomatoes. Assorted meats for him. Tasty, gooey cheese for both. Add a huge, slightly chocolatey iced coffee for each of us and it was love at first sight.

We've returned twice since then, the latest being this morning. We just love this place. All employees we've talked to are so nice (the first time we got a punch card, and they gave us double punches. Weeee!) and both food and drink product is so, so stellar. We don't live very close but when we are in the area, Black Cat is IT!",qaSf-CGQLWlXmy56pkYQYw

Only con is cost, but all coffee houses seem expensive to me and this one runs about average so I will stick with the 5 stars on taste.  Can't wait to be a regular on weekends!",OSgPbiTGuoqlCkaWgekjbg
Food; Coffee & Tea,Gdmig8uYu5Mdfcgn0XsT3Q,Black Cat Coffee House,35,4.5,4.28,5,"First,  let me disclose, I'm not a coffee drinker. (But tea drinkers - I got you, no worries!)  But, don't let that stop you from reading my review or disregard my awesome rating of Black Cat Coffee House.  I have my reasons, I promise!   Read on... 

I LOVE this place!   After 8 years of graduate school visiting many, many coffee shops throughout Tempe, Scottsdale and Phoenix - this is THE place I've been searching for all my life!  (or at least my academic life!)    Free internet makes for a productive work day and with Over Easy next door, there's great people watching for the casual coffee-goer too! 

So, why does a non-coffee drinking coffee-shop hopping academic have to say about this place?  So many things!  where to begin?  

The tea choices...ahh, the tea choices!!!  It's as though I found the end of the rainbow - tea lovers rejoice, b/c this is the place to go for our ""pot o' gold"" (in the form of many, many delicious flavors of tea.)   My favorite:  Cactus Blossom.  I like it iced.  Get it. And I highly recommend you just go ahead and get the medium or large, because I suspect you'll love it as much as I do!   So many other delicious choices - even for people who aren't hardcore tea-drinkers - you'll even find something you love here!!!   Maybe the kiwi-strawberry iced tea as a cool alternative for the summer months?  or Passionfruit.    They also have many more traditional and non-traditional tea flavors.  So many choices, what to do??!?    Also  - my friends who are crazy coffee-aholics like to the coffee here, so while I cannot personally validate it, I would tend to believe them. 

Second reason I love this place: the lighting!   As anyone who spends much time in coffee shops may have realized, often coffee shops are dark.  I like sunshine.  I do live in Phoenix, after all!   There are tables outside and inside, the doors fold wide open and plenty of light gets in, so even if you are slaving away over a paper or dissertation, you'll still soak up some Vitamin D and feel like you are in the land of the living. 

Third reason:  I haven't eaten there yet, but I'm super impressed with food options.  Here's what I've discovered in my coffee shop days - the food is either uber healthy, made for the granola-earth biscuits out there who just rode their bicycle 60 miles in the 115 degree sun to stop in and pick up a green tea, 3 carrot sticks and a vegan cracker for dessert.  (nothing wrong with that, just not everyone's thing)  OR on the other hand, it's a giant double-sized triple chocolate cheesecake, massive bearclaw with a side of donut holes, and a caramel-chocolate-raspberry muffin, which has the caloric equivalent of 6 Big Macs ""super sized"".  So - if you want something more than a seaweed cracker, but don't want to gain 15 lbs from a muffin, this place gets it done.   You can choose from a variety of healthy food options, hot or cold breakfast/lunch items, and if you do feel like splurging - they do have some tasty pastries of normal portion sizes to try too! 

Last - the staff are all friendly and welcoming.  The owner or manager (not sure) has personally stopped by each time I've been there to say hi and check in on how things are.   The place is immaculately clean and the music is mellow and relaxing. The hours are excellent.   

Oh - and tax is included, so the price you see is what you pay.  That's a pretty cool difference from most places!   And drinks are affordable!!  

So, stop by - I'll be the one basking in the sunshine in the corner -  just don't take my spot!   =)",M6Wi9pKDx-W6rGgmf9GVMw

Local, good coffee, friendly service, good ambience, free wifi.  That's what I'm looking for in a cafe when I'm hitting the computer.  I was glad to meet and chat with Don, the owner, both times I visited.

The prices are a little higher than that chain coffee place that shan't be mentioned, but if that's enough to keep you away, this place ain't for you anyway.

I'll definitely be back",LZDOYPPr7ZgdGjtKJg5ZKw
Food; Coffee & Tea,Gdmig8uYu5Mdfcgn0XsT3Q,Black Cat Coffee House,35,4.5,4.27,5,"Favorite coffee shop in Phoenix right here. Where do I begin with my love for this place? Their iced toddy is mind-blowing. No coffee has ever jump started my day the way this stuff does. It is smooth, delicious and full of caffeination.

This place gets major brownie points for having almond milk. Thank God I don't have to ever have another latte with dairy or soy. Their iced chai with almond milk will change your life and it makes their toddy that much smoother.

Their food is delectable. They have Tammie Coe everything and if you haven't tried Tammie Coe cakes, you're missing out. I haven't tried a cupcake, muffin or breakfast sandwich I didn't like (make sure you try a breakfast croissant sandwich with turkey bacon. Earth shattering good.)

Last but definitely not least, their customer service is epic. I have the best convos with these guys and they're always ready to suggest good teas to match my mood or go above and beyond to make my drink perfect. They're like my neighborhood friends. What more could you ask for from a place? The owners of BCCH have done everything right!",Jc5I_HLM1e_GHGiGeBUttw

Black Cat serves one of the best lattes I've ever had.  The peaberry french press was perfectly roasted and perfectly timed.  Great cookies, awesome biscotti.  Modern, relaxing, comfortable decor.  Super friendly service.  Love it!",h2mCt5iGT5UUe0rBZJwesw

Food; Coffee & Tea,Gdmig8uYu5Mdfcgn0XsT3Q,Black Cat Coffee House,35,4.5,3.57,4,"Wow -- I've found another great local coffee house! Being a grad student, coffee houses are my second home, and I much prefer the locally-owned type. 

I found this place by accident one day on my way back to PHX from Scottsdale, along Indian School Rd. The name intrigued me and it was fairly hot outside, and a cold beverage was in order. The guy whipped up a perfectly blended mocha with coconut for me - YUM!  

The interior is long and narrow, and kinda dark (which is fine with me, just mentioning it). The tables along the wall are the bistro/pub set type, which I really like. A sofa and a couple comfy-looking chairs are towards the front, along with 3-4 regular-height tables with four chairs each. 

Black Cat has a frequent visitor program, so be sure to pick up a card at the register -- buy 9, get the 10th free. There's a little outside seating, and they have free Wi-Fi. Also, their prices up on the board already include AZ and PHX tax...I wish everyone in town did that. 

Compared to other local coffee houses like Urban Beans that has a full-on breakfast/brunch/lunch menu, they have a couple of salad options and a few sandwiches. The baked treats in the counter look delectable. I'll definitely be a regular here!",aTi0NVrcPJWbN6jAsJVcAw
Food; Coffee & Tea,Gdmig8uYu5Mdfcgn0XsT3Q,Black Cat Coffee House,35,4.5,4.29,4,"There's a cool cat in town and it's known as Black Cat Coffee House. All they need is some live jazz playing and they'll be set. I wouldn't have expected a cool coffee shop like this to be living in the Safeway shopping center, but it's a great fit! This coffee shop isn't big, but there's enough room to sit and do some work if you want. The menu is a good size for the coffee shop. They offer pastries, a hefty selection of coffee (including a tasty sounding Iced Toffee Mocha!), freshly made loose leaf hot or iced teas and even a couple meal options like a hefty salad or sandwich. I will definitely be back to try more items on their menu, but during my first visit, I enjoyed a refreshing (and quite large) iced tea. It was naturally sweetened and they have about 12+ flavors to choose from. I opted for a berry flavor which I liked. This is definitely a great spot to relax, work or have a meeting!",4ozupHULqGyO42s3zNUzOQ
Food; Coffee & Tea,Gdmig8uYu5Mdfcgn0XsT3Q,Black Cat Coffee House,35,4.5,3.63,4,"This place has everything needed to be a hit.  The espresso is delicious, the sandwiches are homemade, yummy and reasonably priced, the staff is friendly and the environment comfortable.  It's also open until 10 which is nice for those of us who find ourselves tied to desks until 5 or 6.  And bonus - I was visited by one of the owners who sincerely asked if everything was as good as it could be.  Nice touch.

Their web site and social media presence seems to need some help but as they've only been open for 5 months it's understandable.  I'll be going back.",_uLtybFNthITalKyAiFurA
